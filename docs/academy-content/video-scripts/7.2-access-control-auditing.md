## VIDEO SCRIPT

[SCREEN: Continuation from Module 7.1 - "HARDEN PHASE" graphic with access control icons]

Your credentials are locked down. Good. [PAUSE] But there's another question we need to answer: who should have access to what?

[SCREEN: Title card - "Module 7.2: Access Control & Auditing"]

This module is about boundaries. Not everyone needs access to everything. And you need to know what's happening in your systems even when you're not watching.

## SECTION 1: THE PRINCIPLE OF LEAST PRIVILEGE

[SCREEN: Pyramid diagram showing access levels]

There's a concept in security called the Principle of Least Privilege. It sounds academic, but the idea is simple: give people only the access they need to do their job. Nothing more.

[PAUSE]

Think about your house. You probably don't give every visitor a copy of your key. The mail carrier can access your mailbox. A house sitter might get the front door key. Only family has the alarm code.

[SCREEN: House analogy illustration]

Your AI automations should work the same way.

Let me give you a practical example. Say you've built an automation that reads customer emails and logs them to a spreadsheet. [PAUSE] Does that automation need access to delete files from your Google Drive? No. Does it need access to your calendar? No. It needs read access to one inbox and write access to one spreadsheet.

[SCREEN: Diagram showing narrow vs. broad permissions]

But here's what often happens. When you connect Google to Zapier, it asks for a bunch of permissions. Calendar access. Drive access. Contacts access. It's easier to click "allow all" and move on. [PAUSE] Resist that urge.

## SECTION 2: IMPLEMENTING LEAST PRIVILEGE

[SCREEN: Step-by-step process graphic]

Here's how to implement least privilege in your automations.

Step one: before building, write down exactly what access your automation needs. Be specific. Not "Google access" but "read access to the inbox labeled Support Tickets."

[SCREEN: Example access requirements list]
```
Automation: Customer Support Logger
Needs:
- Read: Gmail inbox (Support Tickets label only)
- Write: Google Sheets (Support Log spreadsheet)
Does NOT need:
- Calendar access
- Drive file management
- Contact access
- Send email permission
```

Step two: when connecting services, review the permission scopes. Most platforms let you customize what access you grant. Look for options like "limited access" or "selected folders only."

[PAUSE]

Step three: use dedicated service accounts where possible. Instead of connecting your personal Google account with all its permissions, create a service account that only has access to the specific resources your automation needs.

[SCREEN: Service account creation example]

For Google, this means creating a Google Cloud service account. For other services, look for API-specific credentials rather than OAuth connections to your main account.

## SECTION 3: ROLE-BASED ACCESS FOR TEAMS

[SCREEN: Team hierarchy diagram with roles]

If you're working with a team, you need role-based access control. RBAC for short.

The concept: instead of granting permissions to individuals, you define roles. Then you assign people to roles.

[SCREEN: Example roles]

Role: Admin
- Full access to all automations
- Can create, modify, delete workflows
- Can manage credentials and connections

Role: Developer
- Can create and modify workflows
- Can view credentials but not modify them
- Cannot delete production automations

Role: Viewer
- Can see workflow status and logs
- Cannot modify anything
- Useful for stakeholders who need visibility

[PAUSE]

Zapier, n8n (en-eight-en), and most automation platforms support some form of role-based access. In Zapier, this is handled through team members and folder permissions. In n8n, you can set user roles and workflow-level access.

[SCREEN: Zapier team settings interface mockup]

The benefit of roles: when someone's responsibilities change, you just move them to a different role. When they leave, you remove their role assignment. No hunting through individual permissions.

## SECTION 4: AUDIT LOGS - YOUR BLACK BOX

[SCREEN: Audit log visualization - timeline of events]

Audit logs are the black box recorder of your automations. They tell you what happened, when it happened, and who or what caused it.

[PAUSE]

Why do you need them?

[SCREEN: Three scenarios appearing]

Scenario one: something breaks. Your automation stopped working at 3 AM. The audit log tells you exactly what happened at 3 AM. Maybe an API call failed. Maybe a connected service went down. Maybe someone modified the workflow.

Scenario two: unexpected behavior. Your automation sent an email it shouldn't have. The audit log shows you the trigger, the data that flowed through, and every step that executed.

Scenario three: security investigation. You suspect unauthorized access. The audit log shows every login, every modification, every execution.

[PAUSE]

Most platforms maintain audit logs automatically. Your job is to know where they are and how to read them.

[SCREEN: Where to find audit logs in common platforms]

In Zapier, check the Task History for individual Zaps and the Audit Log in your account settings for administrative actions.

In n8n, execution logs are available for each workflow, and the admin panel shows user activity.

In Claude's console, you can view API usage logs showing every request made with your key.

## SECTION 5: WHAT TO LOG AND HOW LONG TO KEEP IT

[SCREEN: Logging requirements checklist]

Not all logs are created equal. Here's what you should ensure is being captured:

[SCREEN: Essential log items appearing]

Authentication events: who logged in, when, from where.

Workflow modifications: what changed, who changed it, what was the previous state.

Execution logs: when automations ran, what data they processed, what the outcome was.

Error logs: what failed and why. These are gold for debugging.

[PAUSE]

How long should you keep logs?

[SCREEN: Retention recommendations]

For most businesses, ninety days of detailed logs is sufficient for operational purposes. Keep summary logs for a year. If you're in a regulated industry, you may have legal requirements for longer retention.

The key is finding the balance. Too little logging and you're flying blind. Too much and you're drowning in data and potentially storing sensitive information longer than you should.

---

## SECTION 6: SETTING UP ALERTS

[SCREEN: Alert notification icons]

Logs are reactive. You look at them after something happens. Alerts are proactive. They tell you when something happens.

[SCREEN: Alert types]

Set up alerts for:

Unusual activity. If your automation normally runs ten times a day and suddenly runs a thousand times, you want to know.

Failures. If an automation fails, get notified immediately. Don't find out days later when a customer complains.

Security events. Failed login attempts. Permission changes. New API keys created.

Spending thresholds. We covered this in the previous module, but it bears repeating. Set spending alerts on all your API services.

[PAUSE]

Most platforms have built-in alerting. Use it. The few minutes spent configuring alerts can save hours of crisis management later.

## SECTION 7: REGULAR ACCESS REVIEWS

[SCREEN: Calendar with quarterly review marked]

Here's something that often gets forgotten: access review.

Every quarter, take thirty minutes to review who has access to what.

[SCREEN: Review checklist]

Are all team members still current? Remove anyone who's left.

Are permission levels still appropriate? Maybe someone was promoted or changed roles.

Are there any service connections you're no longer using? Disconnect them.

Are there any API keys that should be rotated based on your schedule?

[PAUSE]

This isn't exciting work. But it's the kind of maintenance that prevents the slow accumulation of security debt.

---

## SECTION 8: WRAP UP

[SCREEN: Summary with key icons]

Let's bring it together.

Least privilege: give only the access needed, nothing more.

Role-based access: define roles, assign people to roles, manage at the role level.

Audit logs: know where they are, how to read them, how long to keep them.

Alerts: get notified when something unusual happens.

Regular reviews: quarterly check-ins on who has access to what.

[PAUSE]

[SCREEN: "Next: 7.3 - Responsible AI Principles"]

With your credentials secured and your access controlled, we're ready to tackle the bigger picture. In the next module, we'll discuss responsible AI principles. What should AI not do? How do you maintain human oversight? And what regulations should be on your radar?

[SCREEN: End card with AI Launchpad Academy logo]

See you there.

## PRODUCTION NOTES

- Pacing: Slightly faster than 7.1 since concepts are more straightforward.
- Visuals: Use organizational diagrams, role hierarchies, and log visualizations.
- Practical examples: Show actual UI screenshots where possible for audit logs and team settings.
- Keep the house key analogy relatable and simple.
