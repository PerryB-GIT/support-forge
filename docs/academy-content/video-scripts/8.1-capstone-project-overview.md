## VIDEO SCRIPT

[SCREEN: Dramatic opening - "CAPSTONE PROJECT" text with heroic music cue, graduation cap graphic transforming into automation workflow]

This is it. [PAUSE]

Everything you've learned. Every concept. Every tool. Every technique. It all comes together right here.

[SCREEN: Title card - "Module 8.1: Your First Agent Workflow"]

Welcome to the capstone project of AI Launchpad Academy.

[PAUSE]

You're about to build something real. Something complete. Something you could deploy tomorrow to serve actual clients.

Let's see what we're building.

---

## SECTION 1: INTRODUCING THE CLIENT ONBOARDING AGENT

[SCREEN: "Client Onboarding Agent" title with professional business icons]

Every business has a moment that sets the tone for the entire client relationship: onboarding. [PAUSE]

When a new client signs up, what happens? In most businesses, it's a scramble. Someone needs to send a welcome email. Someone needs to set up their folder in Google Drive. Someone needs to add them to the CRM. Someone needs to notify the team. Someone needs to schedule a kickoff call.

[PAUSE]

A lot of "someones." A lot of manual steps. A lot of room for things to fall through the cracks.

[SCREEN: Animation showing manual chaos transforming into smooth automation flow]

Your capstone project changes that. You're building an intelligent agent that handles client onboarding automatically, professionally, and consistently, every single time.

## SECTION 2: WHAT YOU'LL BUILD

[SCREEN: Architecture diagram appearing piece by piece]

Here's the complete system you're about to create:

[SCREEN: Trigger layer]

**Trigger**: A webhook connected to a client intake form. When someone submits their information, the automation kicks off.

[SCREEN: AI layer]

**Claude AI Processing**: This is the brain. Claude will analyze the new client, determine their needs, and generate a personalized welcome email. Not a template. Not a mail merge. A thoughtfully crafted message that acknowledges who they are and what they need.

[SCREEN: Automation layer]

**Automated Actions**: Based on the client information, your agent will:
- Create a properly organized folder structure in Google Drive
- Add the client to your Google Sheet or CRM with all relevant details
- Schedule a welcome call on Google Calendar

[SCREEN: Notification layer]

**Notifications**: The system will:
- Send the personalized welcome email to the client
- Post a notification to your team's Slack channel so everyone knows a new client has arrived

[PAUSE]

[SCREEN: Full architecture visible]

Trigger, AI processing, automated actions, notifications. That's a complete agent workflow. And you're going to build every piece of it.

## SECTION 3: WHY THIS PROJECT

[SCREEN: Three pillars graphic]

I chose client onboarding for the capstone for three reasons.

[SCREEN: Pillar 1 illuminates]

**Reason one: it's universally valuable.** Every business onboards clients. This isn't a toy example. This is something you could use in your own business or sell to clients as a service.

[SCREEN: Pillar 2 illuminates]

**Reason two: it uses everything you've learned.** Webhooks and triggers. Claude for intelligent processing. Multiple API integrations. Conditional logic. Error handling. Data transformation. It's all here.

[SCREEN: Pillar 3 illuminates]

**Reason three: it's impressive.** When this is done, you'll have something to show. A complete system that transforms a form submission into a fully configured client setup in seconds. That's the kind of automation that makes people understand what AI agents can do.

---

## SECTION 4: SUCCESS CRITERIA

[SCREEN: Checklist with checkboxes]

By the end of this capstone, you will have:

[SCREEN: Items appearing with checkmarks]

A working webhook that receives form submissions.

Claude processing that analyzes client information and generates personalized content.

A Google Drive folder structure created automatically for each new client.

Client data logged to a Google Sheet with all relevant fields populated.

A calendar event scheduled for the welcome call.

A welcome email sent to the client.

A Slack notification alerting your team.

And documentation of your entire system.

[PAUSE]

That's not a simple hello-world exercise. That's a production-grade automation system.

---

## SECTION 5: WHAT YOU'LL NEED

[SCREEN: Requirements checklist]

Before we dive into building, make sure you have:

[SCREEN: Requirements appearing]

Access to n8n (en-eight-en) or Zapier. We'll be building in n8n for this walkthrough, but I'll call out Zapier equivalents as we go.

A Claude API key with available credits.

A Google account with access to Drive, Sheets, and Calendar.

A Slack workspace where you can post messages. If you don't have one, create a free workspace for testing.

An email account you can send from.

[PAUSE]

If any of these aren't set up, pause here and get them ready. We're going to move fast.

## SECTION 6: THE BUILD AHEAD

[SCREEN: Timeline showing three upcoming videos]

Here's what's coming in the next modules:

[SCREEN: Module 8.2 card]

**Module 8.2: Building the Client Onboarding Agent.** This is the main event. Forty minutes of hands-on building. We'll go step by step through every component.

[SCREEN: Module 8.3 card]

**Module 8.3: Testing and Refinement.** We'll run end-to-end tests, handle edge cases, and iterate on the design.

[SCREEN: Module 8.4 card]

**Module 8.4: Certification and Next Steps.** You made it. Quiz time, badges, and a look at where to go from here.

## SECTION 7: LET'S DO THIS

[SCREEN: Energetic transition - "Ready to Build?" text]

I'm excited. You should be too.

[PAUSE]

You walked into this course curious about AI automation. You're about to walk out with a complete, working agent system and the skills to build many more.

[SCREEN: "Next: 8.2 - Building the Client Onboarding Agent" with play button graphic]

Let's build.

## PRODUCTION NOTES

- Pacing: Energetic and exciting. This is the kickoff to the finale.
- Music: Consider upbeat, inspiring background music during the architecture reveal.
- Visuals: Make the architecture diagram look impressive. This should feel like a big deal.
- Tone: Celebratory but focused. They've made it here. Now let's deliver.
- Energy: Higher than previous modules. This is the payoff.
