Welcome to the HARDEN phase of your AI automation journey. [PAUSE]

Everything you've built so far? [PAUSE] It's powerful. It's efficient. And right now, it might be completely exposed to anyone who knows where to look.

[SCREEN: Title card - "Module 7.1: Credential Security"]

I'm going to be direct with you. This module isn't the most exciting content in the course. There's no flashy automation magic here. [PAUSE] But what we cover in the next fifteen minutes might save your business, your reputation, and in some cases, your clients' businesses too.

[PAUSE]

Let's talk about credentials.

## SECTION 1: THE KEYS TO YOUR KINGDOM

Every automation you've built relies on API keys, tokens, and secrets. [PAUSE] These aren't just random strings of characters. They're the keys to your digital kingdom.

Your Claude API key? That's a direct line to your billing account. Someone gets that, they run up charges on your dime.

[SCREEN: Show example API key format - "sk-ant-api03-xxxx..." with portions blurred]

Your Zapier connection tokens? Those have access to every service you've connected. Your email. Your calendar. Your CRM. Your clients' data.

[PAUSE]

Here's what keeps security professionals up at night: most credential theft isn't sophisticated hacking. It's simple carelessness.

## SECTION 2: HORROR STORIES - REAL CONSEQUENCES

Let me share some real scenarios. Names changed, lessons preserved.

[SCREEN: Story card - "The GitHub Mistake"]

Story one. A developer built a small automation for a client. Nothing fancy. Just a script that processed customer orders using Claude. [PAUSE] They pushed their code to GitHub. Public repository. Forgot to remove the API key from the code.

Within four hours, automated bots had found the key. Within twelve hours, the account had processed over two thousand dollars in fraudulent API calls. [PAUSE] The developer ate that cost. The client lost trust. The relationship ended.

[SCREEN: Story card - "The Slack Share"]

Story two. An agency shared their automation workflow in a Slack channel with a client. Helpful screenshot showing the configuration. [PAUSE] The screenshot included a visible API key in the background. That Slack channel had guest access. The key ended up who-knows-where.

[SCREEN: Story card - "The .env Email"]

Story three. A freelancer emailed their dot-env file to themselves as a backup. Gmail indexed it. They searched for something unrelated months later and the file came up in search results. [PAUSE] Anyone with access to their email could have found those credentials just as easily.

[PAUSE]

These aren't edge cases. These are everyday mistakes that happen to smart people who just weren't thinking about security in that moment.

[SCREEN: Transition - "Let's Fix This"]

## SECTION 3: THE DOT-ENV APPROACH

The first principle of credential security: never hardcode secrets.

[SCREEN: Code example showing BAD practice]
```
// NEVER DO THIS
const apiKey = "sk-ant-api03-real-key-here";
```

[PAUSE]

Instead, use environment variables stored in a dot-env file.

[SCREEN: Code example showing GOOD practice]
```
// Do this instead
const apiKey = process.env.CLAUDE_API_KEY;
```

A dot-env file is simple. It sits in your project folder. It contains your secrets. And critically, it never gets committed to version control.

[SCREEN: Example .env file content]
```
CLAUDE_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-xxxx
ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_SECRET=abc123
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=path/to/credentials.json
```

Here's the workflow. Create a file called dot-env in your project root. Add your credentials as key-value pairs. Then, add dot-env to your dot-gitignore file.

[SCREEN: Show .gitignore file with .env listed]

That dot-gitignore file tells Git to completely ignore your dot-env file. It won't be tracked. It won't be committed. It won't end up on GitHub for the world to see.

[PAUSE]

Now, you might be thinking: if I don't commit my env file, how do I share it with collaborators or deploy to production?

Good question. The answer is: you don't share the file itself. You share a template.

[SCREEN: Show .env.example file]
```
# Copy this file to .env and fill in your values
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
ZAPIER_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-webhook-secret
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT=path-to-your-credentials
```

Create a dot-env-dot-example file that shows what variables are needed but contains no actual secrets. This file can be committed. New team members copy it, rename it to dot-env, and fill in their own credentials.

## SECTION 4: API KEY ROTATION

[SCREEN: Calendar icon with rotation arrows]

Here's a question: when was the last time you rotated your API keys?

[PAUSE]

If you had to think about it, it's been too long.

Key rotation means generating new credentials and invalidating the old ones on a regular schedule. Why bother? Two reasons.

[SCREEN: Bullet points appearing one at a time]

First, damage limitation. If a key was compromised and you don't know it, rotation limits how long an attacker has access.

Second, hygiene. Old keys might have been shared in ways you've forgotten. Screenshot in an old email. Saved in a browser somewhere. Rotation cleans the slate.

[PAUSE]

Here's a practical rotation schedule for most automations:

[SCREEN: Rotation schedule graphic]

Production API keys: rotate every ninety days.
Development and testing keys: rotate every thirty days.
Any key you suspect might be compromised: rotate immediately.

[PAUSE]

The process is straightforward. Let me walk you through rotating a Claude API key.

[SCREEN: Claude Console walkthrough - simulated]

Go to console dot anthropic dot com. Navigate to API Keys. Click Create Key. Give it a descriptive name that includes the date. Copy the new key and update your dot-env file. Test your automation to confirm the new key works. Then, and only then, delete the old key.

[PAUSE]

That order matters. Update first, test second, delete last. If you delete the old key before updating, your automation goes down. If you don't delete the old key after updating, you've defeated the purpose of rotation.

## SECTION 5: SECRETS MANAGEMENT FOR TEAMS

[SCREEN: Team icons connected to central vault icon]

If you're working solo, a dot-env file is usually sufficient. But what happens when you have a team? Or multiple projects? Or production deployments that need credentials?

You need a secrets manager.

[SCREEN: Logos for popular secrets managers - AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault, 1Password]

A secrets manager is a secure vault for your credentials. Instead of passing around dot-env files like notes in class, everyone pulls credentials from the same secure source.

For small teams, one-password (1Password) business tier works well. Create a vault for your automation secrets. Team members access what they need. You get an audit log of who accessed what and when.

For larger deployments, AWS Secrets Manager or HashiCorp Vault provide programmatic access. Your automation pulls credentials at runtime instead of storing them in files at all.

[PAUSE]

The key benefit: when someone leaves your team, you revoke their access to the vault. No wondering if they kept a copy of the dot-env file somewhere.

[SCREEN: Transition - "Security Checklist"]

## SECTION 6: YOUR CREDENTIAL SECURITY CHECKLIST

Let's make this actionable. Here's your credential security checklist.

[SCREEN: Checklist appearing item by item with checkboxes]

Checkbox one: all secrets are stored in dot-env files, never in code.

Checkbox two: dot-env is listed in dot-gitignore for every project.

Checkbox three: dot-env-dot-example files exist for every project showing required variables.

Checkbox four: API keys are rotated on a regular schedule. Set calendar reminders.

Checkbox five: old, unused keys are deleted, not just forgotten.

Checkbox six: if working with a team, use a secrets manager instead of shared files.

Checkbox seven: never share credentials via email, Slack, or any logged communication channel.

[PAUSE]

That last one is important. If you must share a credential, use a secure channel like one-password's sharing feature, or share it verbally and have them change it immediately after.

## SECTION 7: WHEN THINGS GO WRONG

What if you discover a key has been exposed?

[PAUSE]

Don't panic. But do act fast.

[SCREEN: Emergency response steps]

Step one: rotate the key immediately. Generate a new one, update your systems, delete the old one.

Step two: check your usage logs. Look for any suspicious activity during the time the key might have been exposed.

Step three: if you find unauthorized usage, contact the service provider. They may be able to reverse charges or provide additional information.

Step four: figure out how it happened. What process failed? Fix that process so it doesn't happen again.

[PAUSE]

Most API providers have monitoring and alerts you can set up. Claude, Zapier, Google, they all let you set spending limits and unusual activity notifications. Enable those. They're your early warning system.

[SCREEN: Anthropic console usage alerts settings]

In the Claude console, you can set monthly spending limits and receive alerts when you hit certain thresholds. If your typical usage is fifty dollars a month and suddenly you're at five hundred dollars in a week, you want to know about that immediately.

## SECTION 8: WRAP UP

[SCREEN: Summary slide with shield icon]

Credential security isn't glamorous. But it's the foundation everything else sits on.

[PAUSE]

Here's what I want you to remember:

Never hardcode secrets. Use environment variables.

Rotate keys regularly. Ninety days for production, thirty for development.

If you have a team, use a secrets manager.

Set up usage alerts and spending limits.

And when in doubt, rotate. A few minutes of updating credentials is better than days of dealing with a breach.

[PAUSE]

[SCREEN: "Next: 7.2 - Access Control & Auditing"]

In the next module, we'll build on this foundation with access control and auditing. How do you make sure people only have access to what they need? And how do you know what's happening in your automations?

[PAUSE]

Take a moment now to check your current projects. Is your dot-gitignore set up correctly? When did you last rotate your keys?

[SCREEN: End card with AI Launchpad Academy logo]

See you in module seven point two.
