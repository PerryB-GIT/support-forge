# Module 5.2: n8n Installation & Setup
## AI Launchpad Academy - CONFIGURE Phase
### Duration: 20 minutes

---

## OPENING (0:00 - 1:00)

[SCREEN: n8n logo with "Installation & Setup" subtitle]

Alright, let's get n8n (pronounced "n-eight-n") up and running. [PAUSE] By the end of this lesson, you'll have a fully functional automation platform ready to build workflows.

[SCREEN: Two paths visualization - Cloud vs Self-Hosted]

We've got two paths here: n8n Cloud, which is the easy button, and self-hosted, which gives you complete control. [PAUSE] I'm going to walk you through both, but here's my honest recommendation upfront.

[SCREEN: Recommendation callout]

If you're new to this, start with n8n Cloud. It's free to try, takes 30 seconds to set up, and you can always migrate to self-hosted later when you understand what you're doing.

---

## N8N CLOUD SETUP (1:00 - 4:30)

[SCREEN: Browser navigating to n8n.io]

Let's start with the cloud option. Head to n8n.io and click "Get Started Free."

[SCREEN: Sign-up page]

Create your account. You can use Google, GitHub, or email. [PAUSE] I'll use email for this demo.

[SCREEN: Account creation flow]

Fill in your details. [PAUSE] They'll ask about your use case - pick whatever fits, this is just for their analytics.

[SCREEN: Workspace creation]

Now you're creating your workspace. Give it a name that makes sense - your business name works fine. [PAUSE] Select your region. Pick whatever's closest to you geographically.

[SCREEN: Dashboard appearing]

And just like that, you're in. [PAUSE] This is your n8n dashboard. Clean, simple, ready to go.

[SCREEN: Free tier limitations callout]

Quick note on the free tier. [PAUSE] You get 5 active workflows and limited executions per month. That's plenty to learn and build your first automations. When you outgrow it, paid plans start around $20 per month.

[SCREEN: Cloud vs Self-Hosted comparison]

The cloud version handles updates, backups, and uptime for you. Trade-off is you're paying for convenience and your data lives on their servers. [PAUSE] For most people starting out, that's a fair trade.

---

## SELF-HOSTED OPTION: DOCKER INSTALLATION (4:30 - 10:00)

[SCREEN: Terminal window opening]

Now let's cover the self-hosted route. [PAUSE] This is where things get more technical, but also more powerful.

[SCREEN: Prerequisites checklist]

You'll need a few things:
- A server or VPS - DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, or even a local machine
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic comfort with the command line

[SCREEN: Docker logo]

If you don't have Docker, pause here and install it. [PAUSE] On Ubuntu, it's:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose
```

[SCREEN: Terminal commands]

For Mac or Windows, download Docker Desktop from docker.com. [PAUSE] Once that's running, we're ready.

[SCREEN: Creating directory structure]

First, let's create a directory for n8n:

```bash
mkdir n8n-docker
cd n8n-docker
```

[SCREEN: docker-compose.yml file opening]

Now we create our Docker Compose file. This tells Docker how to run n8n:

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "5678:5678"
    environment:
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=admin
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=your-secure-password
      - N8N_HOST=localhost
      - N8N_PORT=5678
      - N8N_PROTOCOL=http
      - GENERIC_TIMEZONE=America/New_York
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n

volumes:
  n8n_data:
```

[SCREEN: Highlighting important sections]

Let me break this down. [PAUSE]

Port 5678 is where n8n runs. [PAUSE] The environment variables set up basic authentication - change that password to something secure. [PAUSE] The volume at the bottom persists your data, so you don't lose workflows when the container restarts.

[SCREEN: Terminal running docker-compose]

Save that file as `docker-compose.yml`, then run:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

[SCREEN: Container starting up]

The `-d` flag runs it in the background. [PAUSE] First time takes a minute to download the image.

[SCREEN: Browser opening localhost:5678]

Once it's running, open your browser and go to `localhost:5678`. [PAUSE] You'll see a login prompt. Use the username and password from your Docker Compose file.

[SCREEN: n8n interface loading]

And there it is. [PAUSE] Your own self-hosted n8n instance. Same interface as the cloud version, but running on your hardware.

---

## INITIAL CONFIGURATION (10:00 - 13:00)

[SCREEN: n8n settings panel]

Whether you're on cloud or self-hosted, let's configure a few essentials.

[SCREEN: Settings menu opening]

Click your profile icon in the bottom left, then Settings.

[SCREEN: Personal settings section]

**Personal Settings:** Update your name and email. [PAUSE] This matters when you're collaborating or n8n sends you notifications.

[SCREEN: Credentials section highlighted]

**Credentials:** This is where the magic happens. [PAUSE] Credentials are how n8n connects to other services - Gmail, Google Sheets, Slack, whatever you need.

[SCREEN: Adding a credential example]

Let's add one right now. Click "Add Credential," search for "Google Sheets."

[SCREEN: OAuth flow]

For Google services, you'll connect via OAuth (pronounced "oh-auth"). [PAUSE] Click the button, sign in with your Google account, grant permissions. Done.

[SCREEN: Credential saved confirmation]

That credential is now saved and encrypted. [PAUSE] Any workflow can use it without you re-entering passwords.

[SCREEN: Variables section]

**Variables:** These are reusable values across workflows. [PAUSE] Think of things like your business name, default email addresses, API endpoints. Set them once, use them everywhere.

---

## YOUR FIRST WORKFLOW (13:00 - 18:00)

[SCREEN: New workflow creation]

Let's build something simple to make sure everything works. [PAUSE] Click "New Workflow" in the top right.

[SCREEN: Empty canvas]

You're looking at the workflow canvas. [PAUSE] This is where you'll spend most of your time in n8n.

[SCREEN: Trigger node panel]

Every workflow starts with a trigger. Click the plus sign and search for "Manual Trigger."

[SCREEN: Manual trigger node placed]

This creates a workflow you run by clicking a button. [PAUSE] Perfect for testing.

[SCREEN: Adding second node]

Now click the plus on the right side of that node. Search for "HTTP Request."

[SCREEN: HTTP Request node configuration]

We'll make a simple API call. In the URL field, enter:

```
https://api.quotable.io/random
```

[SCREEN: Configuration options]

This is a free API that returns random quotes. [PAUSE] Leave everything else at defaults.

[SCREEN: Connecting nodes]

The nodes are already connected by that line. [PAUSE] Data flows left to right in n8n.

[SCREEN: Test workflow button highlighted]

Click "Test Workflow" in the top right.

[SCREEN: Execution running]

Watch it run. [PAUSE] The Manual Trigger fires, data flows to the HTTP Request node...

[SCREEN: Output data appearing]

And there's your output. [PAUSE] A random quote pulled from the internet. You can see the JSON response right there.

[SCREEN: Successful execution indicator]

Congratulations. [PAUSE] Your first n8n workflow works.

## UNDERSTANDING THE INTERFACE (18:00 - 19:30)

[SCREEN: Full n8n interface with callouts]

Quick tour of what you're looking at.

[SCREEN: Left sidebar highlighted]

**Left sidebar:** Your workflows list, credentials, and settings. [PAUSE] The home base.

[SCREEN: Top bar highlighted]

**Top bar:** Workflow name, test button, and activation toggle. [PAUSE] Inactive workflows don't run on their own.

[SCREEN: Canvas area highlighted]

**Canvas:** Where you build. [PAUSE] Drag to move around, scroll to zoom. Nodes snap to a grid.

[SCREEN: Execution panel highlighted]

**Execution panel:** Shows past runs and their data. [PAUSE] Essential for debugging when things go wrong.

[SCREEN: Node output view highlighted]

**Node output:** Click any node to see what data went through it. [PAUSE] This is how you understand and troubleshoot your automations.

---

## CLOSING (19:30 - 20:00)

[SCREEN: Recap slide]

You've got n8n running, you understand the interface, and you've built your first workflow. [PAUSE]

[SCREEN: Next lesson preview]

In the next lesson, we go deep. [PAUSE] We'll build three real workflows that actually do something useful for your business: lead capture, content pipelines, and client onboarding.

[SCREEN: Homework callout]

Before you move on, add at least two credentials - Google and one other service you use. [PAUSE] You'll need them ready for what's coming.

[SCREEN: End card with "Next: Building n8n Workflows"]

See you in the next one.
