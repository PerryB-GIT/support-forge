You've built something impressive. [PAUSE] Now let's make sure it actually works.

[SCREEN: Title card - "Module 8.3: Testing & Refinement"]

Testing isn't just running the automation once and calling it done. It's about stress-testing, finding edge cases, and making your system bulletproof.

Let's put your Client Onboarding Agent through its paces.

## SECTION 1: THE END-TO-END TEST

[SCREEN: "End-to-End Testing" with full workflow diagram]

First, the happy path. Let's run a complete test with realistic data.

[SCREEN: Test data form]

Create a test submission with this data:

```json
{
  "businessName": "Mountain View Photography",
  "contactName": "James Chen",
  "email": "your-test-email@example.com",
  "phone": "555-987-6543",
  "services": "We're a wedding and portrait photography studio looking to streamline our client booking process and automate our marketing outreach.",
  "preferredDay": "Thursday",
  "preferredTime": "Afternoon"
}
```

Use your real email so you can see what the client receives.

[PAUSE]

Send that to your webhook. Now watch.

[SCREEN: n8n execution view showing workflow progress]

Watch the execution in n8n. Each node should show a green checkmark as it completes.

[PAUSE]

Now verify each output:

[SCREEN: Verification checklist]

Open Google Drive. Is there a "Mountain View Photography - Client Folder" with subfolders tailored to photography and marketing needs?

Check your Google Sheet. Is there a new row with all the client details and Claude's analysis?

Look at your calendar. Is there a welcome call scheduled for Thursday afternoon?

Check your email. Did you receive a personalized welcome that mentions wedding photography and booking automation?

Check Slack. Did your team channel get the notification?

[PAUSE]

If all five checked out, your happy path is working. But we're not done.

---

## SECTION 2: EDGE CASE TESTING

[SCREEN: "Edge Cases" with warning triangle icon]

Real-world data is messy. Let's see how your automation handles the unexpected.

### Edge Case 1: Missing Fields

[SCREEN: Incomplete form data]

What happens if someone submits the form without filling in all fields?

```json
{
  "businessName": "Quick Test LLC",
  "contactName": "",
  "email": "test@example.com",
  "phone": "",
  "services": "",
  "preferredDay": "Monday",
  "preferredTime": "Morning"
}
```

Send this to your webhook.

[PAUSE]

What happened? [PAUSE] If your workflow errored out, that's a problem. If it completed but with weird results, that's also a problem.

[SCREEN: Adding validation]

The fix: add validation at the start of your workflow.

Add an "IF" node right after your webhook:

```
Condition: {{ $json.email }} is not empty
AND {{ $json.businessName }} is not empty
```

On the true branch, continue with the workflow.
On the false branch, add a "Respond to Webhook" node that returns an error message.

[SCREEN: Error response configuration]

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Missing required fields: email and business name are required"
}
```

Now incomplete submissions get a clear error instead of breaking your system.

### Edge Case 2: Unusual Characters

[SCREEN: Special characters test]

What if a business name has special characters?

```json
{
  "businessName": "O'Brien & Associates, LLC",
  "contactName": "Patrick O'Brien",
  "email": "patrick@obrien-assoc.com",
  "phone": "555-111-2222",
  "services": "Legal consulting firm needing document automation",
  "preferredDay": "Wednesday",
  "preferredTime": "Morning"
}
```

[PAUSE]

Does the folder get created correctly? Does the email render properly? Apostrophes and ampersands can cause issues in certain contexts.

If you find problems, you may need to add a "Code" node to sanitize business names for folder creation while keeping the original for display.

### Edge Case 3: Very Long Input

[SCREEN: Long text test]

What if someone writes a novel in the services field?

```json
{
  "businessName": "Verbose Industries",
  "contactName": "Talkative Tim",
  "email": "tim@verbose.com",
  "phone": "555-333-4444",
  "services": "We are a mid-sized manufacturing company with operations in three states. We manufacture precision components for the aerospace industry. Our current challenges include... [imagine 2000 more characters here]",
  "preferredDay": "Friday",
  "preferredTime": "Evening"
}
```

[PAUSE]

Does Claude handle the long input? Does the Slack message get truncated or error out? Does the Google Sheet handle it?

For Slack, there's a character limit. Add logic to truncate long fields:

```javascript
{{ $json.services.substring(0, 500) }}{{ $json.services.length > 500 ? '...' : '' }}
```

### Edge Case 4: Malformed Email

[SCREEN: Invalid email test]

What if someone enters an invalid email?

```json
{
  "businessName": "Typo Corp",
  "contactName": "Careless Carl",
  "email": "not-a-real-email",
  "phone": "555-555-5555",
  "services": "General consulting",
  "preferredDay": "Tuesday",
  "preferredTime": "Morning"
}
```

[PAUSE]

The Gmail node will likely fail trying to send to an invalid address. Your calendar invite will fail too.

Add email validation to your IF node:

```javascript
{{ $json.email.includes('@') && $json.email.includes('.') }}
```

This is basic validation. For production, consider using a regex pattern.

---

## SECTION 3: ERROR HANDLING

[SCREEN: "Error Handling" with safety net icon]

Even with good validation, external services can fail. The Claude API might be down. Google might have an outage. What then?

[SCREEN: Error workflow configuration]

In n8n, you can add error handling to any node.

Click on a node. Go to Settings. Enable "Continue On Fail."

But that's not enough. You want to know when something fails.

[SCREEN: Error notification branch]

Here's a pattern: after critical nodes, add a check for errors.

After the Claude API call, add an IF node:

```
Condition: {{ $json.error }} is empty
```

True branch: continue normally.
False branch: send an error notification to Slack and log to an error spreadsheet.

[SCREEN: Error notification message]

```
:warning: *Client Onboarding Error*

Workflow failed at: Claude API Call
Client: {{ $('Webhook').item.json.businessName }}
Error: {{ $json.error.message }}

Manual processing required.
```

Now when something breaks, your team knows immediately. The client isn't left hanging without explanation.

---

## SECTION 4: PERFORMANCE CONSIDERATIONS

[SCREEN: "Performance" with speedometer icon]

Your workflow works. But is it fast enough?

[SCREEN: Execution time display]

Check the execution time in n8n. A typical run should complete in ten to thirty seconds. If it's taking minutes, something might be wrong.

[PAUSE]

Common performance issues:

[SCREEN: Issue list]

**Slow Claude responses**: If Claude is taking more than fifteen seconds, consider using a faster model for simpler tasks. Claude Haiku is faster than Claude Sonnet for straightforward content generation.

**Sequential API calls**: If you're making multiple independent API calls, consider running them in parallel using n8n's "Execute Workflow" node with multiple instances.

**Large file handling**: If you're working with attachments, process them asynchronously rather than blocking the main workflow.

[PAUSE]

For client onboarding, thirty seconds is fine. The client submitted a form; they don't expect an instant response. But monitor it. If response times creep up, investigate.

---

## SECTION 5: ITERATION AND IMPROVEMENT

[SCREEN: "Continuous Improvement" with upward arrow]

Your first version is rarely your best version. Here's how to iterate effectively.

[SCREEN: Feedback loop diagram]

**Step one: gather data.** After running for a week or two, look at your logs. What patterns do you see? What fields are people leaving blank? What errors are most common?

**Step two: review outputs.** Read through Claude's generated emails. Are they hitting the right tone? Are they missing anything? Use this feedback to refine your prompts.

**Step three: talk to users.** Ask your team: is the Slack notification giving you what you need? Ask clients: did the onboarding email feel personal?

[PAUSE]

**Step four: refine.** Based on feedback, update your workflow. Maybe you add a field to the intake form. Maybe you adjust Claude's prompt to be more specific. Maybe you add another automation step.

[SCREEN: Version history]

Keep notes on what you change and why. n8n has version history for workflows. Use it. When something breaks, you can roll back. When something works better, you can see what you changed.

## SECTION 6: YOUR TESTING CHECKLIST

[SCREEN: Final testing checklist]

Before you call your capstone complete, run through this checklist:

[SCREEN: Checklist items appearing]

End-to-end test with realistic data passes.

Empty field handling works without errors.

Special characters in business names handled correctly.

Long text inputs don't break anything.

Invalid email addresses are caught.

Error notifications fire when external services fail.

Execution time is reasonable.

Claude outputs are reviewed and refined.

Documentation is complete.

Workflow is set to active.

[PAUSE]

Check all ten, and your Client Onboarding Agent is production-ready.

## SECTION 7: WRAP UP

[SCREEN: "Testing Complete" badge]

Testing isn't glamorous, but it's what separates a demo from a real system.

[PAUSE]

Your automation will encounter weird data. Services will have outages. Users will do unexpected things. By testing for these scenarios now, you've built something that handles reality, not just the happy path.

[SCREEN: "Next: 8.4 - Certification & Next Steps"]

One module left. You've built it. You've tested it. Now let's make it official.

[SCREEN: End card with AI Launchpad Academy logo]

See you in the finale.
