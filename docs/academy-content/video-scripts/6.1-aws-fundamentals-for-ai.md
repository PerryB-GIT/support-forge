# Module 6.1: AWS Fundamentals for AI
## AI Launchpad Academy - CONFIGURE Phase
### Duration: 15 minutes

---

## OPENING (0:00 - 1:00)

[SCREEN: AWS logo with "Fundamentals for AI" subtitle]

Welcome to Module 6: Cloud Deployment. [PAUSE] This is where your AI business goes from local experiments to live production.

[SCREEN: Cloud services floating graphic]

Amazon Web Services - AWS - powers about a third of the internet. [PAUSE] Netflix, Airbnb, NASA, probably your bank. And it's going to power your AI applications too.

[SCREEN: Module objectives]

In this lesson, we'll tour the AWS console, understand the key services you'll actually use, set up proper access controls, and talk about costs before they become surprises.

---

## AWS CONSOLE TOUR (1:00 - 4:00)

[SCREEN: AWS Console login page]

Head to aws.amazon.com and sign in. [PAUSE] If you don't have an account, create one. The free tier gives you 12 months of limited access to most services.

[SCREEN: AWS Console dashboard]

This is the AWS Console. [PAUSE] First impression: overwhelming. Hundreds of services, acronyms everywhere. Don't panic. You'll use maybe six of them regularly.

[SCREEN: Region selector highlighted]

First thing: check your region. [PAUSE] See that dropdown in the top right? It says something like "N. Virginia" or "us-east-1." This matters. Services and data are region-specific.

[SCREEN: Region selection recommendation]

For most AI workloads, stick with us-east-1. [PAUSE] It's the oldest, most feature-complete region. New services launch there first, and pricing is usually lowest.

[SCREEN: Search bar highlighted]

The search bar is your best friend. [PAUSE] Type what you need - S3, Amplify, Lambda - and jump directly there. Don't try to navigate menus.

[SCREEN: Services menu expanded]

If you want to browse, click "Services." [PAUSE] Categories like Compute, Storage, Database, Machine Learning. But honestly, just search.

[SCREEN: Recent services panel]

This panel shows recently visited services. [PAUSE] Once you find what you use regularly, star them for quick access.

## KEY SERVICES FOR AI BUSINESSES (4:00 - 8:00)

[SCREEN: Service icons grid]

Let's cover the services you'll actually touch.

[SCREEN: S3 logo and description]

**S3 - Simple Storage Service** [PAUSE]

Think of it as unlimited hard drive space in the cloud. Store files, host static websites, keep backups. You'll use this constantly.

Pricing: About 2 cents per gigabyte per month. Pennies for most use cases.

[SCREEN: Amplify logo and description]

**Amplify** [PAUSE]

This deploys full-stack web applications. Connect your GitHub repo, Amplify builds and hosts it. Automatic CI/CD, SSL certificates, custom domains. Perfect for Next.js, React, or any modern framework.

We'll do a deep dive next lesson.

[SCREEN: Lambda logo and description]

**Lambda** [PAUSE]

Serverless functions. Write code that runs when triggered - API calls, file uploads, schedules. Pay only when it executes. Zero management.

For AI, Lambda often handles webhook endpoints and simple processing tasks.

[SCREEN: API Gateway logo and description]

**API Gateway** [PAUSE]

Creates REST or WebSocket APIs. Usually paired with Lambda. Your frontend calls API Gateway, Gateway triggers Lambda, Lambda returns data.

[SCREEN: CloudFront logo and description]

**CloudFront** [PAUSE]

Content delivery network - CDN. Caches your content at edge locations worldwide. Makes your site fast everywhere.

Pair S3 with CloudFront for static site hosting that's blazing fast and incredibly cheap.

[SCREEN: Bedrock logo and description]

**Bedrock** [PAUSE]

AWS's AI service. Access Claude, Llama, and other models through AWS infrastructure. Enterprise-grade security and compliance. This is how you run Claude at scale with AWS's infrastructure.

[SCREEN: Quick comparison table]

Quick mental model:
- Store files: S3
- Host apps: Amplify
- Run code: Lambda
- Create APIs: API Gateway
- Go fast: CloudFront
- Use AI: Bedrock

## IAM: ACCESS AND SECURITY (8:00 - 11:30)

[SCREEN: IAM console]

IAM - Identity and Access Management. [PAUSE] This is security, and you need to get it right.

[SCREEN: Root account warning]

Your login email is the root account. [PAUSE] It has unlimited power. Never use it for daily work. Never share it. Enable MFA right now if you haven't.

[SCREEN: MFA setup]

Click your account name, Security credentials, then activate MFA. [PAUSE] Use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Authy.

[SCREEN: Creating IAM user]

Instead of root, create IAM users. [PAUSE] Click "Users" in IAM, then "Add users."

[SCREEN: User setup]

Name: something like "jakeb-admin" [PAUSE]

Enable console access and programmatic access. [PAUSE] Console lets you log in to the web interface. Programmatic access creates API keys.

[SCREEN: Permissions selection]

For permissions, attach the "AdministratorAccess" policy for now. [PAUSE] Yes, this is broad. We'll tighten it later as you learn what you actually need.

[SCREEN: Credential download]

Download those credentials. [PAUSE] Access Key ID and Secret Access Key. Store them somewhere secure - a password manager, not a text file. You cannot retrieve the secret key again after this screen.

[SCREEN: Setting up AWS CLI]

If you're using AWS CLI, configure it with these credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

Enter the access key, secret key, and default region.

[SCREEN: Best practices summary]

IAM best practices:
- Root account: MFA enabled, never used
- Individual users: One per person
- Least privilege: Start broad, narrow down
- Rotate keys: At least annually
- Never commit keys to code repositories

[SCREEN: Warning callout]

Seriously - never put AWS keys in code. [PAUSE] Bots scan GitHub constantly. Your account can be compromised and racking up thousands in charges within hours.

## UNDERSTANDING AWS COSTS (11:30 - 14:00)

[SCREEN: AWS Billing dashboard]

Let's talk money. [PAUSE] AWS billing surprises are legendary horror stories. Let's prevent that.

[SCREEN: Cost Explorer]

Open "Billing and Cost Management" from the account menu.

[SCREEN: Current charges view]

This shows your current month's charges. [PAUSE] Check this weekly while you're learning.

[SCREEN: Setting up billing alerts]

Click "Budgets" then "Create budget."

[SCREEN: Budget configuration]

Create a cost budget:
- **Name:** Monthly Spending Alert
- **Amount:** Start with $10-20 while learning
- **Alert threshold:** 80% of budget

[SCREEN: Notification setup]

Add your email for notifications. [PAUSE] Now you'll get warned before costs spiral.

[SCREEN: Free tier explanation]

The free tier is generous but limited:
- S3: 5GB storage free
- Lambda: 1 million requests free
- Amplify: 1000 build minutes free

[SCREEN: What costs money]

What actually costs money:
- Running EC2 instances 24/7
- Large data transfers out of AWS
- Unused resources you forgot about
- AI model invocations (Bedrock)

[SCREEN: Cost-saving tips]

Cost survival tips:
1. Delete what you're not using
2. Use free tier services when possible
3. Set billing alerts - multiple thresholds
4. Check the billing dashboard weekly
5. For testing, shut things down when done

[SCREEN: Real example]

A typical small AI app might cost:
- Amplify hosting: $0-5/month
- S3 storage: Under $1/month
- Lambda executions: Usually free tier
- Total: Under $10/month

Enterprise is different, but starting out? Very affordable.

## CLOSING (14:00 - 15:00)

[SCREEN: Recap checklist]

You've got the AWS foundation. [PAUSE] You understand the console, know the key services, have secure access set up, and billing alerts in place.

[SCREEN: Action items]

Before moving on:
- Create your IAM user if you haven't
- Enable MFA on your root account
- Set up at least one billing alert
- Star the services we covered for quick access

[SCREEN: Next lesson preview]

Next lesson: AWS Amplify deep dive. [PAUSE] We'll connect your GitHub repo and deploy a real application with custom domain, SSL, and automatic deployments.

[SCREEN: End card]

See you there.
