# Module 5.1: Automation Strategy
## AI Launchpad Academy - CONFIGURE Phase
### Duration: 10 minutes

## OPENING (0:00 - 0:45)

[SCREEN: Animated title "Automation Strategy" with gear icons transforming into workflow diagrams]

Welcome to Module 5, where we enter the Configure phase of your AI business journey. [PAUSE] Over the next 90 minutes, we're going to build the automation engines that will run your business while you sleep.

[SCREEN: Split view - left side shows person working manually, right side shows automated workflows running]

But here's the thing. [PAUSE] Before we touch a single tool, we need to talk strategy. Because the biggest mistake I see new automation builders make? [PAUSE] They automate everything. And that's actually worse than automating nothing.

## THE AUTOMATION DECISION FRAMEWORK (0:45 - 3:00)

[SCREEN: Two platform logos side by side - n8n and Zapier]

Let's start with the big question everyone asks: n8n (pronounced "n-eight-n") versus Zapier. [PAUSE] Here's my honest take.

[SCREEN: Comparison table building out]

**Zapier** is like a luxury sedan. [PAUSE] It's polished, reliable, gets you where you need to go with minimal fuss. You pay a premium, but everything just works. Great for business owners who want results without technical headaches.

**n8n** is like a project car. [PAUSE] More powerful, completely customizable, you can make it do things Zapier can't dream of. But you need to get your hands dirty, understand what's under the hood.

[SCREEN: Decision flowchart appearing]

Here's my decision framework. Ask yourself three questions:

[SCREEN: Question 1 highlighted]

**One:** How technical am I, honestly? [PAUSE] If Docker and self-hosting sound like foreign languages, start with Zapier. No shame in that.

[SCREEN: Question 2 highlighted]

**Two:** What's my budget versus time situation? [PAUSE] Zapier costs more in dollars but less in hours. n8n flips that equation.

[SCREEN: Question 3 highlighted]

**Three:** How complex are my workflows? [PAUSE] Simple triggers and actions? Zapier handles that beautifully. Complex logic with loops, conditionals, and custom code? That's n8n territory.

[SCREEN: Recommendation summary]

My recommendation for most students? [PAUSE] Start with Zapier to get quick wins and understand automation concepts. Then graduate to n8n when you hit Zapier's limits or your bill gets uncomfortable.

## ROI CALCULATOR: WHEN AUTOMATION MAKES SENSE (3:00 - 5:30)

[SCREEN: Calculator interface appearing]

Let's get practical. Not everything should be automated. [PAUSE] Here's how to calculate if a task is worth the effort.

[SCREEN: Formula appearing step by step]

Take any repetitive task and run these numbers:

**Time per occurrence** times **frequency per month** equals **total monthly time**.

[SCREEN: Example calculation]

Let's say you manually add new leads from your website to a spreadsheet. [PAUSE] Takes 3 minutes each time, happens 40 times a month. That's 120 minutes, or 2 hours monthly.

[SCREEN: Automation build time estimate]

Now, how long to automate it? [PAUSE] For a simple form-to-spreadsheet workflow, about 30 minutes to build, maybe an hour with testing.

[SCREEN: ROI visualization]

So you invest 1 hour to save 2 hours every month. [PAUSE] Break-even in 2 weeks. After a year? You've saved 23 hours. That's nearly three full workdays recovered.

[SCREEN: "Worth It" threshold highlighted]

My rule of thumb: if automation saves you more than 2 hours per month and takes less than 4 hours to build, [PAUSE] do it. If it takes longer to build than you'll save in 6 months, [PAUSE] probably skip it.

[SCREEN: Exception callout]

The exception? Error-prone tasks. [PAUSE] If manual execution causes mistakes that cost you money or reputation, automate it even if the time math doesn't quite work out.

## THE DANGER OF OVER-AUTOMATION (5:30 - 7:30)

[SCREEN: Warning icon with "Automation Traps" text]

Now let's talk about the dark side. [PAUSE] Over-automation is real, and it can actually hurt your business.

[SCREEN: Example 1 appearing]

**Trap one: Automating broken processes.** [PAUSE] If your manual workflow is a mess, automating it just creates an automated mess. Faster garbage is still garbage. Fix the process first, then automate.

[SCREEN: Example 2 appearing]

**Trap two: Removing the human touch.** [PAUSE] Some things shouldn't be automated. A genuine "thank you" email after a big purchase? That should come from you, personally. Automate the reminder to send it, not the message itself.

[SCREEN: Example 3 appearing]

**Trap three: Complexity creep.** [PAUSE] You build one automation, then another, then you connect them, add conditions, exceptions, edge cases. [PAUSE] Six months later, you have a Rube Goldberg machine that nobody understands, including you.

[SCREEN: Maintenance cost visualization]

Every automation has maintenance cost. Updates break things. APIs change. What worked yesterday might fail tomorrow. [PAUSE] Keep it simple, keep it documented, and resist the urge to automate everything just because you can.

## IDENTIFYING YOUR FIRST AUTOMATION CANDIDATES (7:30 - 9:15)

[SCREEN: Notepad with task list]

Let's identify what you should automate first. [PAUSE] Grab a piece of paper or open a note and write down every repetitive task you do in your business.

[SCREEN: Common tasks list appearing]

Common candidates:

- Lead capture and organization
- Invoice reminders
- Client onboarding emails
- Social media posting
- Report generation
- Meeting scheduling follow-ups
- Data backup

[SCREEN: Priority matrix - Impact vs Effort]

Now plot them on a simple matrix. [PAUSE] High impact, low effort? Those are your quick wins. Start there.

[SCREEN: "Start Here" arrow pointing to high-impact, low-effort quadrant]

For most service businesses, lead capture is the winner. [PAUSE] Someone fills out your contact form, and within 60 seconds they're in your CRM, you've got a notification, and they've received an acknowledgment email. Zero manual work.

## WHAT'S COMING IN THIS MODULE (9:15 - 10:00)

[SCREEN: Module 5 roadmap graphic]

Here's what we're building in Module 5:

[SCREEN: Lesson list appearing]

In the next lesson, we'll install n8n and get it running. [PAUSE] Then we'll build three complete n8n workflows from scratch: a lead capture system, a content pipeline, and a client onboarding flow.

After that, we'll cover Zapier essentials with two practical examples. [PAUSE] Finally, we'll connect everything to Claude, creating a full loop where AI and automation work together.

[SCREEN: "Your Turn" callout]

Before you move on, take 5 minutes right now. [PAUSE] Write down your top 3 automation candidates using that ROI framework we discussed. You'll be building these by the end of this module.

[SCREEN: End card with "Next: n8n Installation & Setup"]

Alright, strategy session complete. Next up, we get our hands dirty with n8n. See you there.
