# Module 6.4: Cost Management & Optimization
## AI Launchpad Academy - CONFIGURE Phase
### Duration: 10 minutes

---

## OPENING (0:00 - 0:45)

[SCREEN: Dollar signs with cloud icons, "Cost Management" title]

Cloud costs can be a silent business killer. [PAUSE] I've seen startups burn through thousands on forgotten resources. I've seen freelancers shocked by bills ten times what they expected.

[SCREEN: Prevention mindset graphic]

This lesson is about prevention. [PAUSE] Set up the right guardrails now, understand what costs money, and you'll sleep better knowing your cloud bill won't surprise you.

## BILLING ALERTS: YOUR SAFETY NET (0:45 - 3:00)

[SCREEN: AWS Billing dashboard]

First line of defense: billing alerts. [PAUSE] We touched on this in the AWS lesson, but let's go deeper.

[SCREEN: AWS Budgets section]

In AWS, go to Billing, then Budgets. [PAUSE] Create multiple budgets at different thresholds.

[SCREEN: Tiered alert configuration]

I recommend:
- **$10 alert:** Catches unexpected activity early
- **$50 alert:** Something's actually being used
- **$100 alert:** Time to investigate closely
- **Monthly cap alert:** Whatever your maximum is

[SCREEN: Alert notification setup]

Set up email AND SMS alerts for higher thresholds. [PAUSE] Email is easy to miss. A text message gets attention.

[SCREEN: GCP budget setup]

In Google Cloud, go to Billing, then Budgets & alerts. [PAUSE] Same concept - set multiple thresholds, choose notification channels.

[SCREEN: Slack/webhook integration]

Pro move: connect billing alerts to Slack or your automation platform. [PAUSE] A Slack message in your main channel is harder to ignore than an email buried in your inbox.

## WHAT ACTUALLY COSTS MONEY (3:00 - 5:30)

[SCREEN: Cost breakdown pie chart]

Let's demystify where cloud money goes.

[SCREEN: Compute costs]

**Compute:** Running servers. [PAUSE] EC2 instances, Cloud Run, Lambda when it exceeds free tier. The meter runs whenever something's on.

Common trap: Leaving test instances running. [PAUSE] That $0.10/hour EC2 instance is $73/month if you forget about it.

[SCREEN: Storage costs]

**Storage:** S3 buckets, Cloud Storage, databases. [PAUSE] Storage is cheap - pennies per gigabyte. But it adds up if you're storing lots of media or never cleaning up old data.

[SCREEN: Data transfer costs]

**Data Transfer:** Moving data out of the cloud. [PAUSE] This one surprises people. Uploading is usually free. Downloading costs money, especially at scale.

If you're serving lots of video or images, data transfer can be your biggest cost.

[SCREEN: API calls costs]

**API Calls:** AI model usage. [PAUSE] Every Claude API call, every Gemini request, every embedding generation. This is where AI businesses see real expenses.

[SCREEN: Token calculator]

Quick math: [PAUSE]
- Claude Sonnet: roughly $3 per million input tokens, $15 per million output
- Average conversation: maybe 2,000 tokens
- 1,000 daily users with 3 conversations each: around $10-20/day

It adds up, but it's predictable. Track your token usage.

## OPTIMIZATION STRATEGIES (5:30 - 8:00)

[SCREEN: Optimization strategies list]

Here's how to keep costs reasonable.

[SCREEN: Strategy 1 - Right-sizing]

**Strategy 1: Right-size your resources.** [PAUSE]

Don't use a large instance when small works. Don't provision 100GB storage when you need 10. Start small, scale up when metrics prove you need it.

[SCREEN: Strategy 2 - Reserved capacity]

**Strategy 2: Reserve when predictable.** [PAUSE]

If you know you'll need a resource for a year, reserved instances save 30-60%. [PAUSE] AWS Reserved Instances, GCP Committed Use Discounts. Same compute, big savings.

[SCREEN: Strategy 3 - Cleanup unused]

**Strategy 3: Clean up what you're not using.** [PAUSE]

Monthly audit:
- Delete old test environments
- Remove unused S3 buckets and their contents
- Terminate forgotten EC2 instances
- Review and cancel unused domains

AWS has a "Cost Optimization" section that flags underutilized resources. Use it.

[SCREEN: Strategy 4 - Caching]

**Strategy 4: Cache aggressively.** [PAUSE]

CloudFront caching reduces origin requests. Response caching in your app reduces API calls. Every cached response is money saved.

[SCREEN: Strategy 5 - Model selection]

**Strategy 5: Choose the right AI model.** [PAUSE]

Don't use Claude Opus for simple classification - Haiku handles that at a fraction of the cost. Match model capability to task complexity.

| Task | Model | Relative Cost |
|------|-------|---------------|
| Simple classification | Haiku | $ |
| General tasks | Sonnet | $$ |
| Complex reasoning | Opus | $$$$ |

[SCREEN: Strategy 6 - Prompt optimization]

**Strategy 6: Optimize your prompts.** [PAUSE]

Shorter prompts = fewer tokens = lower cost. Don't pad prompts with unnecessary context. Be concise.

## MONTHLY REVIEW RITUAL (8:00 - 9:15)

[SCREEN: Calendar with monthly review marked]

Build a monthly cost review habit.

[SCREEN: Review checklist]

First of each month, check:

1. **Total spend vs budget:** Are you on track?
2. **Cost by service:** What's driving expenses?
3. **Unexpected line items:** Anything surprising?
4. **Unused resources:** What can be deleted?
5. **Optimization opportunities:** What can be downsized?

[SCREEN: AWS Cost Explorer]

AWS Cost Explorer visualizes spending over time. [PAUSE] Filter by service, see trends, spot anomalies.

[SCREEN: Setting calendar reminder]

Set a recurring calendar reminder. [PAUSE] "Cloud Cost Review - 15 minutes." Make it non-negotiable.

---

## CLOSING (9:15 - 10:00)

[SCREEN: Module 6 complete badge]

That's a wrap on Module 6 and the Configure phase. [PAUSE]

[SCREEN: What you've accomplished]

In these two modules, you've:
- Built real automation workflows in n8n and Zapier
- Connected AI intelligence to your automations
- Deployed applications to AWS and explored GCP
- Set up cost controls to protect your business

[SCREEN: Configure phase complete visualization]

Your AI business now has operational infrastructure. [PAUSE] Automations running, apps deployed, costs monitored.

[SCREEN: What's next teaser]

Coming up: the Operate phase. [PAUSE] We'll cover monitoring, maintenance, scaling, and building sustainable AI operations.

[SCREEN: Final action items]

Before you go:
- Set up billing alerts if you haven't
- Do a quick audit of running resources
- Delete anything you created just for testing

[SCREEN: End card with Module 7 preview]

Great work. See you in the Operate phase.
