# Module 5.5: Connecting Automations to Claude
## AI Launchpad Academy - CONFIGURE Phase
### Duration: 15 minutes

---

## OPENING (0:00 - 1:30)

[SCREEN: Title "Connecting Automations to Claude" with neural network and gear icons merging]

This is where everything clicks together. [PAUSE] Literally.

[SCREEN: Diagram showing automation + AI = intelligent systems]

So far, you've built automations that move data and trigger actions. Powerful stuff. [PAUSE] But they're dumb pipes. They do exactly what you tell them, nothing more.

[SCREEN: Claude logo appearing]

Now we add intelligence. [PAUSE] Claude becomes the brain inside your automation body. Data comes in, AI thinks about it, automation acts on that thinking.

[SCREEN: Full loop diagram]

By the end of this lesson, you'll have a complete intelligent loop: triggers, AI processing, and automated actions. [PAUSE] This is the foundation of an AI-powered business.

## THE INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE (1:30 - 3:30)

[SCREEN: Architecture diagram building]

Let me show you how these pieces connect.

[SCREEN: Layer 1 - Triggers]

**Layer 1: Triggers.** Something happens in the world - form submitted, email received, schedule fires. Your automation platform catches it.

[SCREEN: Layer 2 - AI Processing]

**Layer 2: AI Processing.** Data hits Claude's API. [PAUSE] Claude analyzes, summarizes, decides, generates, or transforms. The thinking happens here.

[SCREEN: Layer 3 - Actions]

**Layer 3: Actions.** Based on Claude's output, automations execute. Send emails, update databases, post content, notify teams.

[SCREEN: Feedback loop arrow]

And here's the key: [PAUSE] outputs can become new inputs. The email Claude drafted gets sent, the recipient replies, that reply triggers another cycle. It's a living system.

[SCREEN: Connection methods]

Two main ways to connect Claude to your automations:

**One:** Direct API calls via HTTP Request nodes
**Two:** Native AI nodes in n8n or Zapier's AI actions

We'll cover both.

---

## METHOD 1: HTTP REQUEST TO CLAUDE API (3:30 - 7:30)

[SCREEN: n8n workflow starting]

Let's build a real example in n8n. [PAUSE] We'll create a customer support classifier.

[SCREEN: Workflow overview]

The flow: Email arrives, Claude classifies it as urgent/normal/spam and suggests a response category, automation routes it accordingly.

[SCREEN: Webhook trigger]

Start with a Webhook trigger. [PAUSE] This receives incoming support emails. In practice, you'd connect this to your email system.

[SCREEN: Adding HTTP Request node]

Add an HTTP Request node. [PAUSE] This calls Claude's API directly.

[SCREEN: HTTP configuration - URL]

**URL:** `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`

**Method:** POST

[SCREEN: Headers configuration]

**Headers:**
```
x-api-key: [Your Anthropic API Key]
anthropic-version: 2023-06-01
Content-Type: application/json
```

[SCREEN: Body configuration]

**Body (JSON):**

```json
{
  "model": "claude-sonnet-4-20250514",
  "max_tokens": 500,
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "Classify this customer support email and suggest how to handle it.\n\nEmail Subject: {{ $json.subject }}\nEmail Body: {{ $json.body }}\n\nRespond in JSON format with fields: priority (urgent/normal/low), category (billing/technical/general/spam), suggested_action (escalate/auto-reply/manual-review), and draft_response (a brief suggested reply)."
    }
  ]
}
```

[SCREEN: JSON parsing highlight]

Notice we're asking Claude to respond in JSON. [PAUSE] This makes it easy to use the output in subsequent automation steps.

[SCREEN: Testing the request]

Test with sample data. [PAUSE] Watch Claude's response come back.

[SCREEN: Response parsing]

The response includes Claude's JSON analysis. [PAUSE] Now we can route based on priority and category.

[SCREEN: Adding Switch node]

Add a Switch node. [PAUSE] This is conditional routing in n8n.

[SCREEN: Switch configuration]

Branch based on Claude's priority classification:
- **Urgent:** Immediate Slack alert + escalation
- **Normal:** Add to queue, send acknowledgment
- **Low/Spam:** Log and archive

[SCREEN: Complete flow visualization]

The complete intelligent support system: [PAUSE] Emails come in, Claude triages them instantly, automation routes them appropriately. No human needed for initial classification.

---

## METHOD 2: NATIVE AI NODES (7:30 - 10:00)

[SCREEN: n8n AI nodes panel]

n8n has built-in AI nodes that simplify this. [PAUSE] Let's look at the cleaner approach.

[SCREEN: Adding AI Agent node]

Add the "AI Agent" node. [PAUSE] This is n8n's native Claude integration.

[SCREEN: Agent configuration]

Select Claude as your model. [PAUSE] You'll need to add your Anthropic credentials first.

[SCREEN: System prompt configuration]

**System Prompt:**
```
You are a customer support triage assistant. Analyze incoming support requests and provide structured classification and suggested responses. Always be helpful and professional.
```

[SCREEN: User prompt configuration]

**User Prompt:**
```
Analyze this support email:
Subject: {{ $json.subject }}
Body: {{ $json.body }}

Classify priority (urgent/normal/low), category (billing/technical/general), and suggest a response approach.
```

[SCREEN: Comparing methods]

The native node handles API formatting, error handling, and parsing for you. [PAUSE] Less control, but much cleaner for standard use cases.

[SCREEN: When to use each]

Use HTTP Request when:
- You need custom headers or parameters
- You're using features not yet in native nodes
- You want maximum control

Use native AI nodes when:
- Standard classification, summarization, or generation
- You want simpler maintenance
- You prefer visual configuration

## FULL LOOP DEMO: INTELLIGENT CONTENT SYSTEM (10:00 - 13:30)

[SCREEN: New workflow - Content Intelligence]

Let's build a complete intelligent loop from scratch. [PAUSE] A content intelligence system.

[SCREEN: Workflow diagram]

Here's what it does:
1. Monitors competitor blog (RSS)
2. Claude analyzes each article for insights
3. Generates content ideas based on gaps
4. Creates draft outlines
5. Adds to your content calendar
6. Notifies your team

[SCREEN: Step 1 - RSS Trigger]

**Step 1:** RSS Feed Read trigger. [PAUSE] Point it at a competitor or industry blog.

[SCREEN: Step 2 - Claude Analysis]

**Step 2:** AI Agent node for analysis.

Prompt:
```
Analyze this article for competitive intelligence.

Title: {{ $json.title }}
Content: {{ $json.contentSnippet }}

Provide:
1. Key topics covered
2. Angle or perspective taken
3. What's missing or could be done better
4. 2-3 content ideas we could create that would be more valuable
```

[SCREEN: Step 3 - Idea Generation]

**Step 3:** Another AI Agent for expansion.

Take Claude's content ideas and generate full outlines:
```
Based on this content idea: {{ $json.content_ideas[0] }}

Create a detailed blog post outline including:
- Compelling headline options (3)
- Introduction hook
- Main sections with key points
- Call to action
- Target word count
```

[SCREEN: Step 4 - Google Sheets]

**Step 4:** Google Sheets - Create Row.

Log to your content calendar:
- Title: Claude's best headline
- Outline: The full outline
- Source Inspiration: Link to original article
- Status: "Idea"
- Date Added: Today

[SCREEN: Step 5 - Slack Notification]

**Step 5:** Slack notification to content team.

```
:bulb: New content idea generated

*{{ $json.headline }}*

Inspired by competitor article: {{ $json.source_url }}

Outline added to content calendar. Review when ready.
```

[SCREEN: Complete workflow running]

Run the workflow. [PAUSE] Watch it cascade through each step.

[SCREEN: Results in Sheets and Slack]

Check your spreadsheet - new content idea with full outline. [PAUSE] Check Slack - team notified. From competitor post to actionable content idea in seconds.

## ORCHESTRATION PATTERNS (13:30 - 14:30)

[SCREEN: Orchestration patterns diagram]

A few patterns to remember as you build these systems.

[SCREEN: Pattern 1 - Sequential]

**Sequential:** Each step depends on the previous. [PAUSE] Analysis, then generation, then action. Most common.

[SCREEN: Pattern 2 - Parallel]

**Parallel:** Multiple AI calls at once for different purposes. [PAUSE] Analyze for sentiment AND extract entities AND summarize. Faster, costs more tokens.

[SCREEN: Pattern 3 - Conditional]

**Conditional:** AI decides what happens next. [PAUSE] Classification that routes to different action branches.

[SCREEN: Pattern 4 - Iterative]

**Iterative:** Loop through items, AI processes each one. [PAUSE] Analyze 10 articles, generate ideas for each.

[SCREEN: Cost awareness callout]

Watch your token usage. [PAUSE] Each AI call costs money. Build smart, not excessive.

---

## CLOSING (14:30 - 15:00)

[SCREEN: Recap visualization]

You've connected the pieces. [PAUSE] Automation platforms provide the muscle, Claude provides the brain. Together, they create intelligent systems that actually think.

[SCREEN: Module 5 complete badge]

That completes Module 5: Automation Engines. [PAUSE] You've gone from automation strategy to running intelligent loops.

[SCREEN: Module 6 preview]

Coming up in Module 6: Cloud Deployment. [PAUSE] We'll take everything you've built and deploy it properly - AWS, Amplify, Google Cloud, and keeping costs under control.

[SCREEN: Practice challenge]

Your challenge: Take one of your existing workflows and add Claude intelligence to it. [PAUSE] Even a simple classification or summary step transforms a dumb pipe into a smart system.

[SCREEN: End card]

Great work. See you in Module 6.
