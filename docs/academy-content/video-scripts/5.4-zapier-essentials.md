# Module 5.4: Zapier Essentials
## AI Launchpad Academy - CONFIGURE Phase
### Duration: 20 minutes

---

## OPENING (0:00 - 1:00)

[SCREEN: Zapier logo with "Essentials" subtitle]

Zapier. [PAUSE] Over 7,000 app integrations, used by millions of businesses, and honestly the fastest way to get automations running without touching code.

[SCREEN: Zapier interface preview]

If n8n is the power tool for technical users, Zapier is the Swiss Army knife for everyone else. [PAUSE] Let's master it.

[SCREEN: Lesson objectives]

By the end of this lesson, you'll understand Zapier's interface, know how to create multi-step Zaps, and have two real automations running. Let's go.

---

## UNDERSTANDING THE ZAPIER INTERFACE (1:00 - 4:30)

[SCREEN: Zapier dashboard]

When you log into Zapier, this is your dashboard. [PAUSE] Clean, simple, focused on one thing: getting you to build Zaps.

[SCREEN: Navigation callouts]

Let's break down what you're looking at.

[SCREEN: Left sidebar highlighted]

**Left sidebar:** Your main navigation. [PAUSE] "Zaps" shows everything you've built. "Home" is your dashboard. "Transfers" is for bulk data moves - we'll skip that for now.

[SCREEN: Zaps section highlighted]

The Zaps section has folders for organization. [PAUSE] Create folders by client, by function, whatever makes sense. Don't just dump everything in the root.

[SCREEN: History section]

**Task History:** This is your execution log. [PAUSE] Every time a Zap runs, it shows up here. Green means success, red means something broke. You'll check this when debugging.

[SCREEN: Create button highlighted]

That big "Create" button? [PAUSE] That's where we'll spend most of our time.

[SCREEN: Templates section]

Zapier also has pre-built templates. [PAUSE] Thousands of them. For common workflows, don't reinvent the wheel - start with a template and customize.

---

## ZAPIER TERMINOLOGY (4:30 - 6:00)

[SCREEN: Terminology diagram]

Quick vocabulary lesson. [PAUSE] Zapier has its own language.

[SCREEN: Zap definition]

A **Zap** is a complete automation. [PAUSE] It's the entire workflow from trigger to final action.

[SCREEN: Trigger definition]

A **Trigger** is what starts the Zap. [PAUSE] New email arrives, form submitted, calendar event created. Something happens, Zap fires.

[SCREEN: Action definition]

An **Action** is what the Zap does in response. [PAUSE] Send email, create row, update record. The work that happens after the trigger.

[SCREEN: Task definition]

A **Task** is one successful action. [PAUSE] Zapier bills by tasks. Run 100 Zaps that each do one action? That's 100 tasks.

[SCREEN: Path definition]

**Paths** are conditional branches. [PAUSE] If this, do that. Otherwise, do something else. Like if-else statements.

[SCREEN: Filter definition]

**Filters** stop the Zap if conditions aren't met. [PAUSE] Only continue if the email is from this domain. Only run if the amount is over $100.

---

## CREATING YOUR FIRST ZAP (6:00 - 10:30)

[SCREEN: Click Create - Zaps]

Click "Create" and select "Zaps."

[SCREEN: Zap editor opening]

This is the Zap editor. [PAUSE] Trigger on top, actions below. Simple visual flow.

[SCREEN: Selecting trigger app]

Click "Trigger" and let's pick an app. [PAUSE] Type "Google Forms" and select it.

[SCREEN: Google Forms options]

Zapier shows available triggers. [PAUSE] We want "New Response in Spreadsheet."

[SCREEN: Account connection]

Connect your Google account if you haven't. [PAUSE] Follow the OAuth (oh-auth) flow, grant permissions.

[SCREEN: Selecting form]

Select your spreadsheet and worksheet where form responses land. [PAUSE] If you're following along, create a quick Google Form first.

[SCREEN: Test trigger]

Click "Test trigger." [PAUSE] Zapier pulls recent responses so you have real data to work with.

[SCREEN: Sample data displayed]

See this sample data? [PAUSE] These field names become available in every step below. That's how you reference incoming information.

[SCREEN: Adding action]

Click the plus sign to add an action. [PAUSE] Search for "Slack."

[SCREEN: Slack action options]

Select "Send Channel Message."

[SCREEN: Slack configuration]

Configure it:
- **Channel:** Pick your notifications channel
- **Message Text:** Click in the field, then click the "+" to insert data

[SCREEN: Data mapping]

Build your message by mixing text and data:

```
New form response received!
Name: [Insert Name field]
Email: [Insert Email field]
Message: [Insert Message field]
```

[SCREEN: Formatting options]

You can use Slack markdown. [PAUSE] Asterisks for bold, underscores for italics. Make it scannable.

[SCREEN: Test action]

Click "Test action." [PAUSE] This sends a real message to Slack. Check your channel.

[SCREEN: Slack message confirmation]

There it is. [PAUSE] Your first Zap works.

[SCREEN: Publishing Zap]

Click "Publish." [PAUSE] Give it a clear name: "Google Form to Slack Notification."

Your Zap is now live. Every form response triggers a Slack message automatically.

---

## MULTI-STEP ZAPS (10:30 - 14:00)

[SCREEN: Multi-step diagram]

Single-step Zaps are useful, but multi-step is where Zapier shines. [PAUSE] Chain together as many actions as you need.

[SCREEN: Editing previous Zap]

Let's expand our form notification Zap. [PAUSE] Open it and click the plus after the Slack action.

[SCREEN: Adding Gmail action]

Add "Gmail - Send Email."

[SCREEN: Gmail configuration]

We'll send an auto-reply to the person who submitted:

- **To:** [Insert their Email field]
- **Subject:** "Thanks for reaching out!"
- **Body:**

```
Hi [Insert Name],

Thanks for contacting us. We've received your message and will get back to you within 24 hours.

Best regards,
Your Team
```

[SCREEN: Testing]

Test the action. [PAUSE] Check that the email sends correctly.

[SCREEN: Adding another action]

One more. Click plus, add "Google Sheets - Create Spreadsheet Row."

[SCREEN: Sheets configuration]

This logs every submission to a master tracking sheet:

- **Spreadsheet:** Your leads spreadsheet
- **Worksheet:** The appropriate sheet
- **Row data:** Map each field to columns

[SCREEN: Complete multi-step flow]

Now you have a three-action Zap: [PAUSE] Form submission notifies you on Slack, sends auto-reply to the submitter, and logs everything to a spreadsheet. All automatic.

## EXAMPLE 1: MEETING FOLLOW-UP AUTOMATION (14:00 - 17:00)

[SCREEN: New Zap creation]

Let's build something more sophisticated. [PAUSE] A meeting follow-up system.

[SCREEN: Calendar trigger]

Trigger: Google Calendar - Event End. [PAUSE] This fires when a calendar event finishes.

[SCREEN: Event configuration]

Select your calendar. [PAUSE] Test to pull a recent event.

[SCREEN: Adding filter]

Here's where it gets smart. [PAUSE] Add a "Filter" step.

[SCREEN: Filter configuration]

Configure the filter:
- **Only continue if:** Event Title contains "Client" or "Sales" or "Discovery"

This way, internal meetings don't trigger follow-ups. [PAUSE] Only client-facing meetings do.

[SCREEN: Adding delay]

Add "Delay by Zapier." [PAUSE] Set it to 1 hour.

Why delay? [PAUSE] You don't want to email them the second the meeting ends. Give yourself time to finish notes, then the automation handles follow-up.

[SCREEN: Adding Gmail]

Add Gmail - Send Email.

[SCREEN: Email configuration]

Configure the follow-up:

- **To:** You'll need the attendee email from the event data
- **Subject:** "Great meeting - next steps from [Event Title]"
- **Body:**

```
Hi,

It was great connecting during our [Event Title] call today.

As discussed, here are the next steps:
[You'll fill this in via the Zapier email draft feature, or use a template]

Looking forward to our continued conversation.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

[SCREEN: Important callout]

Pro tip: [PAUSE] Instead of sending directly, use "Gmail - Create Draft." This queues up the follow-up for you to review and personalize before sending. Best of both worlds.

[SCREEN: Complete flow]

The flow: Meeting ends, waits an hour, creates a draft follow-up email for client meetings only. [PAUSE] You never forget to follow up again.

## EXAMPLE 2: SOCIAL MEDIA CONTENT REPURPOSING (17:00 - 19:30)

[SCREEN: New Zap creation]

One more practical example: content repurposing. [PAUSE]

[SCREEN: RSS trigger]

Trigger: RSS by Zapier - New Item in Feed.

[SCREEN: RSS configuration]

Feed URL: Your blog's RSS feed. [PAUSE] Every new post you publish triggers this.

[SCREEN: Adding Formatter]

Add "Formatter by Zapier" - Text - Truncate.

[SCREEN: Truncate configuration]

This shortens your blog content for social media:
- **Input:** The blog post content
- **Max Length:** 250 characters
- **Append:** "..."

[SCREEN: Adding LinkedIn]

Add LinkedIn - Create Share Update.

[SCREEN: LinkedIn configuration]

- **Comment:** [Insert truncated content]
- **Content URL:** [Insert blog post URL]
- **Content Title:** [Insert blog title]

[SCREEN: Adding parallel path for Twitter alternative]

You can add paths here to post to multiple platforms. [PAUSE] Same content, different formats for each network.

[SCREEN: Complete flow]

The result: Publish a blog post, automatically share to LinkedIn with a proper preview. [PAUSE] Expand it to Twitter, Facebook, wherever your audience lives.

---

## CLOSING (19:30 - 20:00)

[SCREEN: Recap slide]

You've mastered Zapier basics. [PAUSE] You understand the interface, built multi-step Zaps, and created two real automations.

[SCREEN: Zapier vs n8n comparison reminder]

Remember: Zapier excels at quick integrations and non-technical users. [PAUSE] If you find yourself fighting its limitations, that's when n8n becomes attractive.

[SCREEN: Next lesson preview]

Next lesson brings it all together. [PAUSE] We'll connect these automations to Claude, creating intelligent loops where AI handles the thinking and automations handle the doing.

[SCREEN: Practice assignment]

Your assignment: Build one Zap that solves a real problem in your business. [PAUSE] Don't pick something theoretical - pick something you actually need.

[SCREEN: End card]

See you in the next one.
