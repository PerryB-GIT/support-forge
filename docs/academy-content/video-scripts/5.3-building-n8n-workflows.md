# Module 5.3: Building n8n Workflows
## AI Launchpad Academy - CONFIGURE Phase
### Duration: 25 minutes

---

## OPENING (0:00 - 1:30)

[SCREEN: "Building n8n Workflows" title with three workflow icons]

Time to build real automations. [PAUSE] In this lesson, we're creating three complete workflows that you can deploy in your business today.

[SCREEN: Three workflow cards appearing]

Here's what we're building:

**One:** Lead Capture - Form submission to Google Sheet to email notification. [PAUSE] Never miss a lead again.

**Two:** Content Pipeline - RSS feed to AI summary to Slack notification. [PAUSE] Stay on top of industry news without the time sink.

**Three:** Client Onboarding - Webhook trigger to folder creation to welcome email. [PAUSE] Professional onboarding on autopilot.

[SCREEN: Design principles intro]

But first, let's cover the principles that separate amateur automations from professional ones.

---

## WORKFLOW DESIGN PRINCIPLES (1:30 - 4:00)

[SCREEN: Principle 1 with icon]

**Principle One: Single Responsibility.** [PAUSE] Each workflow should do one thing well. Don't try to cram your entire business into one mega-workflow. [PAUSE] Three focused workflows beat one complex mess every time.

[SCREEN: Principle 2 with icon]

**Principle Two: Error Handling.** [PAUSE] What happens when something fails? Because it will fail. API goes down, credentials expire, data comes in weird. Plan for it. n8n has error handling nodes - use them.

[SCREEN: Principle 3 with icon]

**Principle Three: Clear Naming.** [PAUSE] Name your workflows and nodes descriptively. "Workflow 1" tells you nothing. "Lead Capture - Website Form to CRM" tells you everything.

[SCREEN: Principle 4 with icon]

**Principle Four: Test Before You Trust.** [PAUSE] Never activate a workflow without running it manually first. Test with real data, weird data, missing data. Find the edge cases before your customers do.

[SCREEN: Principle 5 with icon]

**Principle Five: Document Your Logic.** [PAUSE] Use the notes feature in n8n. Future you will thank present you when something breaks at 2 AM.

## COMMON N8N NODES (4:00 - 6:30)

[SCREEN: Node catalog grid]

Before we build, let's tour the nodes you'll use constantly.

[SCREEN: Trigger nodes section]

**Triggers** - These start your workflow:
- **Webhook:** Receives data from external sources
- **Schedule:** Runs at specific times (cron jobs)
- **Form Trigger:** Built-in forms that capture data
- **Email Trigger:** Watches an inbox for new messages

[SCREEN: Action nodes section]

**Actions** - These do things:
- **HTTP Request:** Call any API
- **Google Sheets:** Read/write spreadsheet data
- **Gmail/Email:** Send messages
- **Slack:** Post to channels
- **If:** Conditional branching
- **Set:** Transform and modify data

[SCREEN: AI nodes section]

**AI Nodes** - The good stuff:
- **OpenAI:** GPT for text generation
- **AI Agent:** Complex reasoning chains
- **Text Classifier:** Categorize content automatically

[SCREEN: Utility nodes section]

**Utilities:**
- **Code:** Custom JavaScript or Python
- **Merge:** Combine data streams
- **Split Out:** Process arrays item by item
- **Wait:** Pause execution

---

## WORKFLOW 1: LEAD CAPTURE (6:30 - 12:00)

[SCREEN: New workflow creation]

Let's build. Create a new workflow and name it "Lead Capture - Website Form."

[SCREEN: Adding Form Trigger]

Click the plus and search for "n8n Form Trigger." [PAUSE] This is a built-in form that n8n hosts for you.

[SCREEN: Form configuration panel]

Configure the form fields. We'll keep it simple:
- **Name** - Text field, required
- **Email** - Email field, required
- **Phone** - Text field, optional
- **Message** - Text area, required

[SCREEN: Form URL displayed]

See that URL at the top? [PAUSE] That's your form's live address. People can submit directly to it, or you can embed it on your website.

[SCREEN: Adding Google Sheets node]

Next node: Google Sheets. [PAUSE] Click the plus, search for it, select "Append or Update Row."

[SCREEN: Google Sheets configuration]

Select your credential. [PAUSE] For the spreadsheet, you'll need to create one first with columns matching your form: Name, Email, Phone, Message, Date.

[SCREEN: Mapping fields]

Map the fields:
- Name column: `{{ $json.Name }}`
- Email column: `{{ $json.Email }}`
- Phone column: `{{ $json.Phone }}`
- Message column: `{{ $json.Message }}`
- Date column: `{{ $now.format('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm') }}`

[SCREEN: Expression editor showing]

That dollar-sign syntax? [PAUSE] That's how n8n references data. The `$json` object contains whatever came from the previous node.

[SCREEN: Adding Gmail node]

Third node: Gmail - Send Email. [PAUSE] This notifies you when a lead comes in.

[SCREEN: Gmail configuration]

Configure it:
- **To:** Your email address
- **Subject:** `New Lead: {{ $json.Name }}`
- **Body:**
```
New lead submitted!

Name: {{ $json.Name }}
Email: {{ $json.Email }}
Phone: {{ $json.Phone }}
Message: {{ $json.Message }}

Submitted at: {{ $now.format('yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm') }}
```

[SCREEN: Complete workflow view]

Here's the complete flow: [PAUSE] Form submission triggers the workflow, data saves to your sheet, you get an email. Three nodes, fully automated lead capture.

[SCREEN: Testing the workflow]

Let's test. Click "Test Workflow," then open the form URL in a new tab. [PAUSE] Fill it out with test data, submit.

[SCREEN: Execution success]

Watch the execution. [PAUSE] Green checks across the board. Check your spreadsheet - new row. Check your email - notification arrived.

[SCREEN: Activating the workflow]

Toggle the workflow to Active. [PAUSE] It's now live, 24/7, capturing leads while you do other things.

---

## WORKFLOW 2: CONTENT PIPELINE (12:00 - 17:30)

[SCREEN: New workflow - Content Pipeline]

New workflow: "Content Pipeline - AI News Digest."

[SCREEN: Schedule Trigger node]

Start with Schedule Trigger. [PAUSE] We want this running every morning.

[SCREEN: Schedule configuration]

Set it to run daily at 8 AM. [PAUSE] The cron expression is `0 8 * * *` if you want to use advanced mode.

[SCREEN: RSS Feed Read node]

Next: RSS Feed Read. [PAUSE] This pulls articles from any news source.

[SCREEN: RSS configuration]

For the URL, let's use a tech news feed:
```
https://feeds.feedburner.com/TechCrunch/
```

You can use any RSS feed - industry publications, competitor blogs, whatever you need to track.

[SCREEN: Limit items option]

Set "Limit" to 5. [PAUSE] We don't need every article, just the top stories.

[SCREEN: Adding OpenAI node]

Here's where it gets interesting. [PAUSE] Add an OpenAI node - specifically "Message a Model."

[SCREEN: OpenAI configuration]

Model: GPT-4 or GPT-3.5-turbo. [PAUSE]

For the prompt:
```
Summarize this news article in 2-3 sentences. Focus on why it matters for business owners. Be concise.

Title: {{ $json.title }}
Content: {{ $json.contentSnippet }}
```

[SCREEN: Showing data flow]

The RSS node outputs an array of articles. [PAUSE] n8n automatically runs the OpenAI node for each one. No loops needed.

[SCREEN: Adding Slack node]

Final node: Slack - Send Message.

[SCREEN: Slack configuration]

Select your workspace and channel. [PAUSE] For the message:

```
*{{ $('RSS Feed Read').item.json.title }}*
{{ $json.message.content }}

<{{ $('RSS Feed Read').item.json.link }}|Read Full Article>
```

[SCREEN: Complete workflow view]

The complete pipeline: [PAUSE] Every morning at 8 AM, grab the latest articles, AI summarizes each one, summaries post to Slack. Stay informed in 60 seconds instead of 60 minutes.

[SCREEN: Testing with manual trigger]

For testing, add a Manual Trigger temporarily so you don't have to wait until 8 AM. [PAUSE] Run it now.

[SCREEN: Slack messages appearing]

Check Slack. [PAUSE] Five summaries, perfectly formatted, ready to skim.

---

## WORKFLOW 3: CLIENT ONBOARDING (17:30 - 23:00)

[SCREEN: New workflow - Client Onboarding]

Last one: "Client Onboarding - New Client Setup."

[SCREEN: Webhook Trigger]

Start with Webhook trigger. [PAUSE] This receives data from external sources - your payment processor, CRM, or booking system.

[SCREEN: Webhook configuration]

Copy the webhook URL. [PAUSE] You'll paste this wherever your client signup happens. When someone pays or books, it hits this URL with their information.

[SCREEN: Expected data structure]

We'll expect this data structure:
```json
{
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "company": "Smith Co",
  "package": "Premium"
}
```

[SCREEN: Adding Google Drive node]

First action: Google Drive - Create Folder.

[SCREEN: Drive configuration]

This creates a client folder for deliverables. [PAUSE]

Folder name: `{{ $json.company }} - {{ $json.name }}`
Parent folder: Select your "Clients" folder

[SCREEN: Adding Google Docs node]

Next: Google Docs - Create Document.

[SCREEN: Docs configuration]

This creates a welcome document. [PAUSE]

Name: `Welcome - {{ $json.name }}`
Folder: The folder we just created (use `{{ $('Google Drive').item.json.id }}`)
Content: A templated welcome message with their details

[SCREEN: Adding Gmail node]

Now Gmail - Send Email for the welcome message.

[SCREEN: Gmail configuration with HTML]

This is where you make an impression. [PAUSE]

To: `{{ $json.email }}`
Subject: `Welcome to [Your Business], {{ $json.name }}!`
Body type: HTML

```html
<h2>Welcome aboard, {{ $json.name }}!</h2>

<p>We're thrilled to have you as a {{ $json.package }} client.</p>

<p>Here's what happens next:</p>
<ol>
  <li>You'll receive access to your client folder within 24 hours</li>
  <li>Our team will reach out to schedule your kickoff call</li>
  <li>Review the welcome document we've prepared for you</li>
</ol>

<p>Questions? Reply to this email anytime.</p>

<p>Best,<br>Your Name</p>
```

[SCREEN: Adding Slack notification node]

One more: Slack notification to your team.

[SCREEN: Slack team notification]

Channel: Your team channel
Message:
```
:tada: New client signed up!

*{{ $json.name }}* from *{{ $json.company }}*
Package: {{ $json.package }}

Folder created, welcome email sent. Ready for kickoff.
```

[SCREEN: Adding error handling]

Let's add error handling. [PAUSE] Click "Add Error Trigger" in the workflow settings.

[SCREEN: Error workflow branch]

Add a Gmail node that emails you if anything fails. [PAUSE] Subject: "ALERT: Onboarding Failed for {{ $json.name }}"

[SCREEN: Complete workflow view]

The complete onboarding flow: [PAUSE] Client signs up, folder created, documents prepared, welcome email sent, team notified. All in about 3 seconds.

[SCREEN: Testing with webhook.site]

To test without real signups, use webhook.site or send a test POST request with the expected JSON.
