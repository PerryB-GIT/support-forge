# Module 6.3: Google Cloud for AI Workloads
## AI Launchpad Academy - CONFIGURE Phase
### Duration: 15 minutes

---

## OPENING (0:00 - 1:00)

[SCREEN: Google Cloud logo with AI graphics]

Google Cloud Platform - GCP. [PAUSE] While AWS dominates overall cloud market share, Google has carved out serious territory in AI and machine learning.

[SCREEN: Why GCP for AI]

Why consider GCP? [PAUSE] They built TensorFlow. They run the AI behind Google Search, YouTube, and Gmail. Vertex AI gives you access to Gemini and other frontier models. Plus BigQuery is unmatched for large-scale data analysis.

[SCREEN: Lesson objectives]

Today we'll tour the GCP console, explore Vertex AI for model access, touch on BigQuery for data work, and understand when GCP makes more sense than AWS.

---

## GCP CONSOLE ORIENTATION (1:00 - 3:30)

[SCREEN: GCP Console login]

Head to console.cloud.google.com. [PAUSE] Sign in with your Google account.

[SCREEN: Project selection]

GCP organizes everything into projects. [PAUSE] Think of projects as containers. Each project has its own billing, permissions, and resources.

[SCREEN: Creating first project]

Click the project dropdown, then "New Project." [PAUSE] Name it something meaningful - "ai-launchpad-learning" works.

[SCREEN: Console dashboard]

The dashboard shows your project overview. [PAUSE] Different layout than AWS, but same concept. Search bar up top, services in the left navigation.

[SCREEN: Navigation menu]

Click the hamburger menu. [PAUSE] This expands the full service catalog. Categories like Compute, Storage, AI & Machine Learning.

[SCREEN: Pinning services]

Pin your frequently used services to the top. [PAUSE] Right-click any service and pin it. Keeps your workflow tight.

[SCREEN: Cloud Shell]

Notice Cloud Shell in the top right - that terminal icon. [PAUSE] This gives you a browser-based command line with Google Cloud SDK pre-installed. Incredibly handy for quick operations.

---

## VERTEX AI OVERVIEW (3:30 - 8:00)

[SCREEN: Vertex AI in navigation]

Search for "Vertex AI" and open it.

[SCREEN: Vertex AI dashboard]

Vertex AI is Google's unified AI platform. [PAUSE] Model training, deployment, and access to pre-built models like Gemini.

[SCREEN: Model Garden]

Click "Model Garden." [PAUSE] This is the catalog of available models.

[SCREEN: Model categories]

You'll see:
- **Foundation models:** Gemini, PaLM, Imagen
- **Open models:** Llama, Mistral, Gemma
- **Task-specific models:** Code generation, embeddings, vision

[SCREEN: Gemini model card]

Click on Gemini. [PAUSE] This is Google's flagship model - their answer to GPT-4 and Claude.

[SCREEN: Try in Studio]

Click "Open in Vertex AI Studio." [PAUSE] This is like the ChatGPT interface but for Gemini.

[SCREEN: Vertex AI Studio interface]

Here you can:
- Chat with Gemini directly
- Test different prompts
- Adjust parameters like temperature
- Save conversations as examples

[SCREEN: API access]

For production, you'll use the API. [PAUSE] Click "Get code" to see examples in Python, Node.js, curl.

```python
import vertexai
from vertexai.generative_models import GenerativeModel

vertexai.init(project="your-project-id", location="us-central1")
model = GenerativeModel("gemini-1.5-flash")

response = model.generate_content("Explain quantum computing simply")
print(response.text)
```

[SCREEN: Model deployment options]

Vertex AI also lets you:
- Fine-tune models on your data
- Deploy custom models as endpoints
- Create model pipelines

[SCREEN: Comparison note]

When to use Vertex AI vs direct Claude API? [PAUSE]

Use Vertex AI if:
- You need Gemini specifically
- You're already deep in GCP infrastructure
- You need Google's compliance and enterprise features

Use Anthropic directly if:
- Claude is your primary model
- You want simpler integration
- You prefer Anthropic's direct relationship

---

## BIGQUERY BASICS (8:00 - 12:00)

[SCREEN: BigQuery in navigation]

Now let's look at BigQuery. [PAUSE] Search and open it.

[SCREEN: BigQuery console]

BigQuery is Google's data warehouse. [PAUSE] It handles massive datasets - we're talking petabytes - with SQL queries that complete in seconds.

[SCREEN: Why AI businesses need it]

Why does an AI business care? [PAUSE]

- Analyze user behavior at scale
- Process training data
- Store and query conversation logs
- Build analytics dashboards

[SCREEN: Creating a dataset]

Let's set up a dataset. [PAUSE] In the Explorer panel, click the three dots next to your project, then "Create dataset."

[SCREEN: Dataset configuration]

- **Dataset ID:** `ai_analytics`
- **Location:** US (multi-region for availability)
- **Default expiration:** Leave blank for now

[SCREEN: Creating a table]

Inside your dataset, create a table. [PAUSE] You can upload CSV, JSON, or connect to Cloud Storage.

[SCREEN: Schema definition]

Define your schema:

```
conversation_id: STRING
user_input: STRING
model_response: STRING
tokens_used: INTEGER
response_time_ms: FLOAT
timestamp: TIMESTAMP
```

[SCREEN: Writing SQL queries]

Now query your data with SQL:

```sql
SELECT
  DATE(timestamp) as date,
  COUNT(*) as conversations,
  AVG(tokens_used) as avg_tokens,
  AVG(response_time_ms) as avg_response_time
FROM `your-project.ai_analytics.conversations`
WHERE timestamp > TIMESTAMP_SUB(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP(), INTERVAL 30 DAY)
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY date DESC
```

[SCREEN: Query results]

Results come back fast, even on millions of rows. [PAUSE] This is the power of BigQuery's columnar architecture.

[SCREEN: Cost model]

Pricing note: [PAUSE] BigQuery charges per query based on data scanned. The first terabyte per month is free. After that, $5 per TB scanned.

Pro tip: use `LIMIT` and partition your tables to control costs.

## GCP VS AWS: WHEN TO USE WHICH (12:00 - 14:00)

[SCREEN: Comparison diagram]

Real talk: you don't have to choose one cloud exclusively. [PAUSE] Many businesses use both.

[SCREEN: Choose AWS when]

**Choose AWS when:**
- You need the broadest service catalog
- Enterprise clients expect AWS compliance
- You're deploying full-stack web apps (Amplify)
- Lambda and API Gateway fit your architecture
- You want Bedrock for multi-model AI access

[SCREEN: Choose GCP when]

**Choose GCP when:**
- You need Gemini specifically
- Heavy data analytics work (BigQuery)
- You're in the Google ecosystem (Workspace, Android)
- You want integrated AI training (Vertex AI)
- Kubernetes is central to your stack (GKE is excellent)

[SCREEN: Multi-cloud reality]

The hybrid approach works well: [PAUSE]
- Host your app on AWS Amplify
- Use Claude API directly from Anthropic
- Analyze data in BigQuery
- Pull in Gemini for specific tasks via Vertex AI

[SCREEN: Authentication across clouds]

For multi-cloud, manage credentials carefully. [PAUSE] Use environment variables, secret managers, and never hardcode keys.

---

## CLOSING (14:00 - 15:00)

[SCREEN: GCP summary]

Google Cloud is a powerful complement to your toolkit. [PAUSE] Vertex AI for model access, BigQuery for analytics, and solid infrastructure overall.

[SCREEN: Action items]

Your next steps:
- Create a GCP project if you haven't
- Try Vertex AI Studio with Gemini
- Explore BigQuery's free sandbox
- Think about what data you'll eventually analyze

[SCREEN: Cost reminder]

GCP also has a free tier - $300 in credits for new accounts. [PAUSE] Experiment without risk.

[SCREEN: Final module lesson preview]

Final lesson coming up: Cost Management and Optimization. [PAUSE] We'll make sure all this cloud power doesn't blow your budget.

[SCREEN: End card]

See you there.
