## Part 4: ROI Calculations

### Monthly Net Benefit

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Labor savings | $9,382 |
| Error reduction | $3,357 |
| Opportunity value | $7,500 |
| **Gross monthly benefit** | **$20,239** |
| Less: Ongoing costs | -$500 |
| **NET MONTHLY BENEFIT** | **$19,739** |

### Payback Period

```
Payback = One-time costs / Net monthly benefit
Payback = $4,255 / $19,739
Payback = 0.22 months (approximately 1 week)
```

**Payback Period: Less than 1 month**

### Annual ROI

```
Annual Benefit = Net monthly benefit x 12 = $19,739 x 12 = $236,868
Annual Cost = One-time + (Monthly x 12) = $4,255 + $6,000 = $10,255
Net Annual Gain = $236,868 - $10,255 = $226,613

ROI = (Net Annual Gain / Total Investment) x 100
ROI = ($226,613 / $10,255) x 100 = 2,210%
```

**Annual ROI: 2,210%**

### 3-Year Total Value

| Year | Benefits | Costs | Net Value |
|------|----------|-------|-----------|
| Year 1 | $236,868 | $10,255 | $226,613 |
| Year 2 | $236,868 | $6,000 | $230,868 |
| Year 3 | $236,868 | $6,000 | $230,868 |
| **3-Year Total** | **$710,604** | **$22,255** | **$688,349** |
