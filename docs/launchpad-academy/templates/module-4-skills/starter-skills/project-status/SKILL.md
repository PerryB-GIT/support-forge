# Project Status

Generate a project status report by analyzing recent git activity, file changes, and progress metrics.

## Trigger

- /project-status
- /status-report
- /project-report
- "generate project status"
- "what's the project status"
- "create a status report"

## Context

This skill generates status reports for software projects by examining git history, recent changes, and optionally integrating with project management tools. It's useful for weekly updates, stakeholder communication, and team syncs.

## Inputs

| Input | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| project_path | string | No | Path to project (default: current directory) |
| time_period | string | No | Period to report on: "today", "week", "month" (default: week) |
| format | string | No | Output format: "summary", "detailed", "executive" (default: summary) |

## Instructions

1. **Identify the Project**
   - Use the current directory if no path specified
   - Verify it's a git repository
   - Identify the project name from package.json, Cargo.toml, or directory name
   - If not a git repo, ask the user for project details manually

2. **Gather Git Metrics**
   - Run `git log` to get commits from the specified time period
   - Count total commits
   - Identify contributors
   - List branches with recent activity
   - Check for any merged PRs

3. **Analyze Changes**
   - Run `git diff --stat` to identify files changed
   - Categorize changes:
     - Features (new files, new functions)
     - Bug fixes (commits with "fix" in message)
     - Refactoring (commits with "refactor" in message)
     - Documentation (changes to .md files, comments)
     - Tests (changes to test files)
   - Note any breaking changes

4. **Check Project Health**
   - Look for any failing tests (if test command available)
   - Check for dependency updates needed
   - Identify any TODO or FIXME comments added
   - Note any security advisories if available

5. **Compile Accomplishments**
   - Summarize completed work
   - List merged features
   - Note resolved issues

6. **Identify In Progress**
   - Check for uncommitted changes
   - Look at open branches
   - Note any stashed work

7. **Generate Report**
   - Format according to requested format (summary/detailed/executive)
   - Present to user

8. **Offer Distribution**
   - Copy to clipboard
   - Save to file
   - Send via email (if Gmail MCP available)
   - Post to Slack (if available)

Would you like me to save this to a file, copy it, or adjust the format?

## Dependencies

- Git (required)
- Package manager files for project detection (optional)
- GitHub MCP for PR information (optional)

## Notes

- This skill works best in git repositories
- For non-git projects, it will rely on manual input from the user
- The "executive" format is designed for non-technical stakeholders
- Consider running this skill weekly and saving reports for historical tracking
- Commit messages greatly affect report quality - encourage conventional commits
