## Call Structure

### Opening (2 min)
"Thanks for taking the time, [Name]. I reviewed your intake form and I'm excited to learn more about [Company]. Before we dive in, is there anything that's changed since you submitted that form?"

### Discovery (10-15 min)
1. "Walk me through a typical day/week - where do you feel like you're wasting the most time?"

2. "You mentioned [pain point from form] - can you give me a specific example of when that cost you time or money?"

3. "What have you already tried to solve this?"

4. "If we could wave a magic wand and fix one thing, what would have the biggest impact on your business?"

5. "Who else would be involved in this decision? Who needs to be trained?"

### Education (5 min)
"Let me quickly explain how Launchpad Pro works..."
- Explain LAUNCH Method (30 seconds each phase)
- Timeline expectations (2-4 weeks)
- What's included vs what's not
- Post-launch support

### Qualifying (3 min)
1. "Based on what you've described, this sounds like a [tier] engagement. Does a budget of $X-$Y align with what you had in mind?"

2. "What's your ideal start date?"

3. "Is there anyone else who needs to be part of the next conversation?"

3. Upon approval, we kick off within [X days]

Does that work for you?"

**If not qualified:**
"Based on what you've shared, I think Launchpad Academy might be a better fit for where you are right now. It's self-paced, costs $997, and you'd learn everything we'd implement for you. Would you like me to send you more info on that?"
