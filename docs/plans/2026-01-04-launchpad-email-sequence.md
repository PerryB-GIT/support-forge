# AI Launchpad Email Launch Sequence

## Complete 7-Email Campaign for Support Forge

---

## EMAIL 1: ANNOUNCEMENT/TEASER

**Subject Line:** We've been building something for 6 months...
**Alternative Subject:** The AI problem no one's talking about

**Preview Text:** And it's finally ready. Here's the first look.

---

**Body Copy:**

Quick question:

How many AI tools are you paying for right now that you haven't touched in weeks?

ChatGPT Plus. Copilot. Claude. Midjourney. That automation tool you swore would change everything.

If you're like most business owners we talk to, the answer is somewhere between "too many" and "I'm afraid to check."

Here's the thing—it's not your fault.

The AI industry sold you subscriptions without selling you implementation. They gave you the keys to a Ferrari and said "good luck figuring out the clutch."

For the past 6 months, we've been building the solution.

**AI Launchpad** launches next week.

It's a structured program that takes businesses from "paying for AI we don't use" to "AI is now our competitive advantage."

Not theory. Not another course that sits in your login graveyard. A proven method we've tested across 50+ businesses.

More details coming Thursday.

For now, just know this: if you've ever felt like AI should be doing more for your business, you're right. And we're going to show you exactly how.

P.S. — We're limiting the first cohort. If you want priority access, reply with "READY" and we'll make sure you're first in line.

## EMAIL 2: PROBLEM AGITATION

**Subject Line:** $4,788/year on AI tools you don't use
**Alternative Subject:** The subscription graveyard in your business

**Preview Text:** We did the math. It's worse than you think.

---

**Body Copy:**

Let's do some uncomfortable math.

The average SMB owner we surveyed is paying for:
- ChatGPT Plus: $240/year
- Microsoft Copilot: $360/year
- At least one AI writing tool: $200-500/year
- Some automation platform: $300-600/year
- Miscellaneous AI subscriptions: $200-400/year

**Total: $1,300-2,100/year minimum.**

Usage rate? Under 15%.

That means you're burning $1,000+ annually on tools that sit there, unused, while you keep doing things the hard way.

But here's what really gets me:

**It's not about the money. It's about what you're NOT getting.**

Every day without proper AI implementation is:
- 2-3 hours lost to tasks AI could handle
- Competitive advantage bleeding to rivals who figured it out
- Your team doing $20/hour work when they should be doing $200/hour work

One client told us: "I felt like I was watching the future happen to other businesses while I just kept paying for the tickets."

The frustration isn't that AI doesn't work.

It's that you KNOW it should be working for you, and you can't figure out why it isn't.

Here's the uncomfortable truth:

**The problem isn't the tools. The problem is nobody taught you the system.**

You wouldn't expect to be fluent in Spanish by downloading Duolingo and never opening it. But somehow, we expect AI fluency to happen through subscription osmosis.

It doesn't work that way.

You need a method. A structure. A system that takes you from "I have AI tools" to "AI runs half my business."

That's exactly what we built.

Tomorrow, I'll show you the framework we've used to transform 50+ businesses from AI-confused to AI-powered.

P.S. — Go check your subscriptions right now. Add them up. Then ask yourself: "What am I actually getting from this?" If the answer makes you wince, Thursday's email is for you.

## EMAIL 3: SOLUTION INTRODUCTION

**Subject Line:** The LAUNCH Method: How we fixed AI implementation
**Alternative Subject:** 6 steps to AI that actually works

**Preview Text:** Landscape. Architect. Unlock. Network. Configure. Harden.

---

**Body Copy:**

Every business that fails at AI makes the same mistake:

They start with tools.

"What AI should I use?" Wrong question.
"How do I write better prompts?" Wrong question.
"Should I get ChatGPT or Claude?" Wrong question.

The right question: **"What does AI need to transform in my specific business?"**

That's why we built the LAUNCH Method.

It's the exact 6-phase framework we use with every client, and it's why our implementations actually stick.

**L — LANDSCAPE**
We map your entire business operation. Every process. Every bottleneck. Every hour wasted on repetitive tasks. You can't automate what you haven't documented.

**A — ARCHITECT**
We design your AI stack. Not "what's popular"—what YOUR business needs. Custom tool selection based on your actual workflows, team skills, and growth goals.

**U — UNLOCK**
This is where most programs stop. We go further. We build the prompts, templates, and systems that unlock real productivity. Not generic—built for your industry, your voice, your operations.

**N — NETWORK**
AI tools are powerful alone. They're transformative when connected. We integrate your stack so data flows, tools talk to each other, and automation compounds.

**C — CONFIGURE**
We set up your dashboards, workflows, and team access. When we're done, anyone on your team can use AI effectively—not just the "tech person."

**H — HARDEN**
Most AI implementations fail at month 3. Ours don't. We build in accountability systems, measurement frameworks, and iteration processes that make AI adoption permanent.

This isn't theory. We've run 50+ businesses through this framework.

Average results:
- 12+ hours saved per week within 60 days
- 3-5 AI tools fully integrated (not just purchased)
- Team adoption rate over 80%

**AI Launchpad is how we're bringing the LAUNCH Method to more businesses.**

Two options:

**Academy** — Learn the system yourself with our complete course, templates, and community.

**Pro** — We implement everything with you, for you.

Full details on both tiers coming tomorrow.

**[Join the waitlist for early access →]**

— Support Forge Team

P.S. — The LAUNCH Method came from failure. We watched too many businesses buy AI tools and never use them. So we reverse-engineered what the successful ones did differently. This is that playbook.

---

## EMAIL 4: SOCIAL PROOF/CREDIBILITY

**Subject Line:** "We saved $34,000 in the first quarter"
**Alternative Subject:** What 47 businesses learned about AI

**Preview Text:** Real results from real implementations.

---

**Body Copy:**

I could tell you AI Launchpad works.

But you'd be smart to be skeptical. Everyone claims their thing works.

So instead, here's what actual businesses experienced:

---

**Maven Property Management (12 employees)**

Before: "We had Copilot, ChatGPT, and three different automation tools. Nobody used any of them consistently."

After LAUNCH: "Our leasing coordinator now processes applications in 20 minutes instead of 2 hours. Our maintenance request system runs on autopilot. We calculated $34,000 saved in Q1 alone—mostly from hours reclaimed."

*Biggest win: Team adoption went from 10% to 85%*

---

**Northstar Consulting (Solo operator)**

Before: "I was drowning in proposal writing. Each one took 4-6 hours. I knew AI could help but couldn't figure out how to make it sound like me."

After LAUNCH: "I built a proposal system using Claude that captures my voice perfectly. I went from 5 proposals/month to 20. My close rate actually improved because I could respond faster."

*Biggest win: Revenue up 3x without hiring*

---

**Bridgewater Legal Services (8-person firm)**

Before: "We're attorneys. We're naturally skeptical. But we were watching competitors use AI for research and document review while we did everything manually."

After LAUNCH: "Legal research that took associates 10 hours now takes 2. Our document analysis system paid for the entire program in the first month."

*Biggest win: Associates focusing on strategy instead of searches*

---

**Here's what all the success stories have in common:**

1. They weren't "tech people"
2. They'd already tried (and failed) to implement AI on their own
3. They followed the LAUNCH Method systematically
4. They had support when they got stuck

That's exactly what AI Launchpad provides.

Tomorrow I'll break down both tiers—Academy and Pro—so you can decide which path fits your situation.

P.S. — I asked Marcus from Maven Property what advice he'd give to someone on the fence. His answer: "Stop calculating whether you can afford it. Calculate what it's costing you to wait."

## EMAIL 5: TIER BREAKDOWN

**Subject Line:** Academy vs. Pro: Which path is right for you?
**Alternative Subject:** $997 or $7,500? Here's how to decide.

**Preview Text:** The full breakdown of both AI Launchpad tiers.

---

**Body Copy:**

AI Launchpad has two paths.

Same LAUNCH Method. Same results. Different levels of support.

## EMAIL 6: FAQ/OBJECTION HANDLING

**Subject Line:** "What if I'm not technical?"
**Alternative Subject:** Every question you have, answered

**Preview Text:** Plus the questions you didn't think to ask.

---

**Body Copy:**

Enrollment opens tomorrow.

Before it does, let me address everything that might be holding you back.

---

**"I'm not technical. Will this work for me?"**

The LAUNCH Method was built for non-technical business owners. 87% of our successful implementations were with people who described themselves as "not tech-savvy." We don't teach coding. We teach systems thinking and tool usage.

---

**"I've tried to implement AI before and failed."**

Good. That means you understand the problem. Most AI implementations fail because they start with tools instead of strategy. The LAUNCH Method is specifically designed to fix this—we've refined it through 50+ real implementations. Your past failure is actually useful data.

---

**"$997 (or $7,500) is a significant investment."**

It is. Here's the math: The average business owner wastes $1,300+/year on unused AI subscriptions, plus loses 10+ hours/week to tasks AI could handle. At $50/hour (conservative), that's $26,000/year in lost productivity. Academy costs 3.8% of that annual loss. Pro costs 28-57% of ONE year's loss for a permanent capability.

---

**"What if it doesn't work for my industry?"**

We've implemented across: legal services, property management, consulting, healthcare admin, e-commerce, agencies, financial services, construction, and manufacturing. The LAUNCH Method is industry-agnostic because it starts with YOUR processes, not generic templates.

---

**"I don't have time to learn something new."**

Two responses: (1) Academy requires 5-10 hours/week for 4-6 weeks. The ROI in hours saved is typically 3:1 by week 8. (2) If time is truly your constraint, Pro exists exactly for this reason—we do the heavy lifting.

---

**"My team won't use it."**

Team adoption is built into the methodology. The "Harden" phase specifically addresses this with accountability systems, easy-access dashboards, and gradual capability building. Our implementations average 80%+ team adoption.

---

**"What if AI changes and this becomes obsolete?"**

It will change. That's why Academy includes lifetime updates and quarterly sessions on new developments. The LAUNCH Method is framework-based—the principles adapt even as specific tools evolve. We update the curriculum every quarter.

---

**"Can I talk to someone before deciding?"**

For Academy: Join the community after purchase. Full refund within 14 days if it's not right for you.

For Pro: Yes. Reply to this email with "CALL" and we'll schedule a 20-minute fit call before enrollment opens.

---

**"What's your refund policy?"**

Academy: 14-day money-back guarantee. Complete Module 1, do the exercises. If you don't see the path forward, we refund everything.

Pro: We offer a results guarantee. If we don't deliver measurable improvement in your first 60 days (defined during onboarding), we continue working at no charge until we do.

---

**One question we get asked that I want to address directly:**

**"Is this just a cash grab riding the AI hype wave?"**

Fair question given how much noise is in this space.

Here's our answer: Support Forge has been doing implementation consulting for 7 years. We added AI implementation 2 years ago because clients kept asking. AI Launchpad is the productization of work we've been doing successfully. We're not AI hype merchants—we're operators who figured out how to make AI actually work for real businesses.

---

**Tomorrow at 9am EST, enrollment opens.**

Academy spots: Unlimited
Pro spots: 15 for this cohort

Priority list members get 2-hour early access.

## EMAIL 7: FINAL CALL/URGENCY

**Subject Line:** Doors are open (15 Pro spots available)
**Alternative Subject:** AI Launchpad is live

**Preview Text:** Academy unlimited. Pro limited to 15.

---

**Body Copy:**

**AI Launchpad is officially open.**

**[Enroll in Academy — $997 →]**

**[Apply for Pro — $7,500-15,000 →]**

---

Here's where we stand:

**Academy:** Open enrollment, unlimited spots. Lifetime access to the LAUNCH Method course, templates, community, and quarterly updates.

**Pro:** 15 spots for this cohort. Done-with-you implementation, dedicated specialist, team training, 90-day follow-up, custom builds.

---

I'll keep this short because you already know if this is for you.

You know if you've been paying for AI tools you don't use.

You know if you've been meaning to "figure out AI" but haven't.

You know if you're watching competitors move faster while you stay stuck.

**The question isn't whether AI will matter for your business.**

The question is whether you'll be implementing it systematically, or still "meaning to figure it out" six months from now.

**The LAUNCH Method is how you stop hoping and start implementing.**

---

**For Academy enrollees:**

You'll get immediate access to:
- Complete course (24 modules)
- All templates and prompt libraries
- Community access
- Your first implementation assignment

Most people complete their Business Landscape Map (Module 1) within 48 hours of enrolling. That single exercise shows you exactly where AI can make the biggest impact in your specific business.

**[Enroll in Academy — $997 →]**

---

**For Pro applicants:**

After you apply, we'll schedule a 20-minute call to ensure fit. If we're aligned, you'll meet your implementation specialist within 72 hours.

Your LAUNCH Method implementation typically begins the following week.

15 spots. When they're gone, the next cohort opens in 8 weeks.

**[Apply for Pro →]**

---

**Two final things:**

**1. The guarantee is real.**

Academy: 14 days, no questions asked.
Pro: Results guarantee—we deliver measurable improvement in 60 days or continue working free until we do.

**2. The time cost of waiting is real.**

Every week without systematic AI implementation is 10+ hours of your life spent on tasks that don't need you. That's not dramatic—it's math.

Here's to AI that finally works.
