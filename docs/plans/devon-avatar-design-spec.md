### 4.2 Script Writing Style Guide

**Structure Template:**

```markdown
## [Lesson Title]

### INTRO (Avatar - Full Screen)
"Hey there! Welcome to [topic]. In this lesson, we're going to..."

### CONTEXT (Avatar or Animated)
"Before we dive in, let me explain why this matters..."

### WALKTHROUGH (Screen + Voice)
[Step-by-step instructions with screen capture]

### SUMMARY (Avatar - Full Screen)
"Great work! You just [accomplishment]. Next up, we'll..."
```

**Language Guidelines:**

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| "Let's set up your first..." | "Now I will show you how to..." |
| "You might be wondering..." | "Obviously, you need to..." |
| "This can feel tricky at first..." | "This is simple, just..." |
| "Together, we'll build..." | "I'm going to demonstrate..." |
| "Nice work!" | "Good job, student" |

**Sentence Construction:**
- Start with action verbs when possible
- Keep sentences under 20 words for narration
- Use contractions naturally (you'll, we're, let's)
- Break complex instructions into numbered steps
- Pause-worthy content should be its own sentence

### 4.3 Phrases & Catchphrases

|---------|--------|
| Module start | "Welcome to [Module Name]! I'm Devon, and I'll be your guide as we..." |
| Lesson start | "Hey there! Ready to [action]? Let's dive in." |
| Returning | "Welcome back! Last time we [recap]. Today, we're taking it further." |

**Transition Phrases:**

| Context | Phrase |
|---------|--------|
| Moving forward | "Now that we have that set up, let's move on to..." |
| Showing screen | "Let me show you exactly what this looks like..." |
| Complex topic | "This next part has a few moving pieces. Don't worry - we'll take it step by step." |

**Encouragement Phrases:**

### 4.4 Things to Avoid

**Never Say:**

| Avoid | Why | Instead |
|-------|-----|---------|
| "It's easy" / "It's simple" | Dismisses learner struggles | "This is straightforward once you see it" |
| "Obviously" / "Of course" | Makes people feel dumb | "As you might expect" / "Here's the key" |
| "Just" (minimizing) | "Just click here" minimizes effort | "Click here to..." |
| "I assume you know..." | Creates exclusion | "Quick reminder that..." |
| Jargon without explanation | Loses non-technical users | Define terms on first use |
| "Don't worry about that" | Creates uncertainty | "We'll cover that in Module X" |

**Never Do:**

- Rush through complex steps
- Skip explanation of "why"
- Use condescending tone
- Make gender assumptions about learners
- Reference competitors negatively
- Promise specific outcomes ("You WILL make $X")
- Use outdated references or memes

**Tone to Avoid:**

- Corporate/stiff language

- Apologetic language ("Sorry, this is complicated")
