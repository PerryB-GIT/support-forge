## Script Completeness Analysis

### Scripts Ready for Production
All 35 scripts are complete and production-ready. Each includes:
- Duration estimates with word counts
- Section breakdowns with timestamps
- Screen directions/visual cues
- Pronunciation guides where needed
- Production notes with tone and pacing guidance

### Missing Scripts
Based on the course outline, no scripts are missing. All modules (0-8) have complete coverage.

### Scripts Needing Enhancement
None identified. All scripts have:
- Clear opening hooks
- Logical flow
- Practical exercises where appropriate
- Closing CTAs and transitions

## Production Recommendations

### Recording Order
1. **Batch by environment** - Record all AWS-related content together, all n8n content together, etc.
2. **Talking head first** - Get presenter segments done in dedicated sessions
3. **Screen captures by platform** - Reduces context switching

### Quality Checklist Per Video
- [ ] Script reviewed and timed
- [ ] All screen environments prepared
- [ ] Assets/graphics ready
- [ ] Test recordings for audio levels
- [ ] B-roll footage identified
- [ ] Captions/transcript prepared

### Estimated Production Timeline
- **Phase 1 (Priority 1)**: 3-4 weeks for 15 videos
- **Phase 2 (Priority 2)**: 4-5 weeks for 17 videos
- **Phase 3 (Priority 3)**: 1 week for 3 videos
- **Post-Production**: 2 weeks for editing, captions, thumbnails

---

## Notes

- Scripts use consistent pronunciation guides for technical terms
- All scripts include [PAUSE] markers for pacing
- Module 8.2 (40 min) could be split into two parts if needed
- Consider creating short "recap" videos for each module completion
