## [avatar] Feature Spotlight: Ticket Management

Today I want to highlight our ticket management system and show you how
AI-powered categorization saves your team hours every week.

When a new ticket arrives, Support Forge automatically analyzes the content
and suggests the most appropriate category, priority level, and even the
best team member to handle it.

Our smart routing ensures that tickets get to the right person the first time,
reducing handoffs and improving resolution times.

Let me show you how this works in practice...

## [avatar] Feature Spotlight: Knowledge Base

Your team's expertise shouldn't live in individual inboxes. Support Forge's
integrated knowledge base captures solutions and makes them searchable.

When handling tickets, suggested articles appear automatically based on the
issue description. This helps newer team members resolve tickets with the
confidence of a seasoned veteran.

Plus, every resolved ticket can be converted into a knowledge article with
just one click.
