Get Today's Date Context\nNote the current date and day of week. Consider if it's a\nMonday (include weekend context) or Friday (note upcoming weekend).\n\n### 2. Calendar Review\nUse the Google Calendar MCP tools to:\n- Fetch all events for today\n- Fetch events for tomorrow (preview)\n- Identify any conflicts or back-to-back meetings\n\nPresent calendar as a timeline format:\n```\nTODAY'S SCHEDULE\n\n9:00 AM - Team standup (30 min)\n10:00 AM - Client call with Acme (1 hr)\n[2 hour gap]\n1:00 PM - Lunch with Sarah (1 hr)\n```\n\n### 3. Email Scan\nUse Gmail MCP tools to:\n- Find unread emails from the last 24 hours\n- Prioritize emails from known important contacts\n- Flag any emails with \"urgent\" or \"asap\" in subject\n\nSummarize as:\n```\nEMAIL SUMMARY\n\n- 3 unread emails\n- 1 flagged as urgent: \"Q4 Budget Review\" from CFO\n- Notable: Response needed on Project Alpha proposal\n```\n\n### 4. Daily Priorities\nBased on calendar and email analysis, suggest top 3 priorities\nfor the day. Consider:\n- Meetings that need prep\n- Deadlines mentioned in emails\n- Gaps in schedule for deep work\n\n### 5. Delivery Format\nPresent everything in a clean, scannable format. Start with\na one-line summary: \"You have X meetings today, Y urgent items.\"\n\nKeep total briefing under 500 words unless the day is unusually complex.\n\n- No arguments required for basic briefing\n- Optional: \"tomorrow\" or specific date for different day\n- Optional: \"detailed\" for expanded email summaries\n\nA formatted briefing in the terminal, ready to read in under 2 minutes.\n\n### Basic Invocation\nUser: /morning\nResponse: Full briefing for today\n\n### Specific Date\nUser: /morning tomorrow\nResponse: Briefing for tomorrow's schedule\n\n### Detailed Mode\nUser: /morning detailed\nResponse: Briefing with full email previews instead of summaries\n```",
