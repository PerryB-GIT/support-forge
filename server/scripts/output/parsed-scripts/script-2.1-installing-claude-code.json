  "raw_content": "# Script 2.1: Installing Claude Code\n\n**Duration:** 15 minutes (~2250-2550 words)\n**Lesson:** Module 2, Lesson 1\n**Purpose:** Windows/WSL, Mac, and Linux installation procedures\n\n---\n\n## OPENING\n\n[SCREEN: \"Module 2: ARCHITECT Phase\" title card]\n\nWelcome to Module 2, the Architect phase. This is where we master Claude Code, your AI development partner.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: \"Installing Claude Code\" lesson title]\n\nBefore we can use it, we need to install it. In this lesson, I'll walk you through installation on Windows with WSL (W-S-L), Mac, and Linux. Find your operating system section and follow along.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nBy the end, you'll have Claude Code running and authenticated. Let's get it set up.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n---\n\n## PREREQUISITES CHECK\n\n[SCREEN: Prerequisites checklist]\n\nBefore we start, let's make sure you've got what you need.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Node.js requirement]\n\nYou need Node.js (node-J-S) version eighteen or higher installed. If you're not sure, open a terminal and type node dash dash version. If you see a version number starting with eighteen or higher, you're good.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Node.js installation page]\n\nIf you don't have Node, go to nodejs.org (node-J-S dot org) and download the LTS (L-T-S) version. That stands for Long Term Support, which means it's stable. Run the installer, accept the defaults.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Anthropic account reminder]\n\nYou also need your Anthropic account ready. You created this in Module 1. We'll grab an API (A-P-I) key during this installation.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n---\n\n## WINDOWS INSTALLATION (WITH WSL)\n\n[SCREEN: Windows logo with WSL callout]\n\nLet's start with Windows. We're going to use WSL, the Windows Subsystem for Linux. This gives you a proper Linux environment inside Windows, which makes development work much smoother.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: PowerShell admin window]\n\nFirst, open PowerShell as Administrator. Right-click the Start menu, select \"Windows Terminal (Admin)\" or \"PowerShell (Admin).\"\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: WSL install command]\n\nType this command: wsl dash dash install\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nHit Enter. Windows will download and install WSL with Ubuntu (oo-BOON-too) as the default Linux distribution. This might take a few minutes depending on your internet speed.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Restart prompt]\n\nWhen it's done, you'll probably need to restart your computer. Do that.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Ubuntu first-time setup]\n\nAfter restart, open Ubuntu from your Start menu. First time launching, it'll ask you to create a username and password. This is your Linux user, separate from Windows. Pick something simple you'll remember.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Ubuntu terminal ready]\n\nNow you've got a Linux terminal running inside Windows. This is where we'll install Claude Code.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: npm install command]\n\nIn the Ubuntu terminal, type: npm install dash g at anthropic slash claude-code\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nThe dash g flag installs it globally so you can run it from anywhere. npm will download the package and its dependencies.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Installation progress]\n\nYou'll see a progress bar as packages download. When it finishes without errors, you're ready to authenticate.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Authentication command]\n\nType: claude\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nThis launches Claude Code for the first time. It'll prompt you to authenticate.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Browser authentication flow]\n\nA browser window should open automatically, taking you to Anthropic's login page. If it doesn't, copy the URL (U-R-L) from the terminal and paste it into your browser.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Anthropic login]\n\nSign in with your Anthropic account. Authorize the connection when prompted.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Success message in terminal]\n\nBack in your terminal, you should see a success message. Claude Code is now installed and authenticated.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Quick test]\n\nLet's verify it works. Type: claude \"Hello, are you working?\"\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nIf Claude responds, you're all set. Windows users, you can skip to the end of this lesson.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n---\n\n## MAC INSTALLATION\n\n[SCREEN: Apple logo]\n\nMac users, you've got the smoothest installation process.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Terminal application]\n\nOpen Terminal. You can find it in Applications, then Utilities, or just search for \"Terminal\" using Spotlight.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Check Node version command]\n\nFirst, verify Node is installed. Type: node dash dash version\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nIf you see version 18 or higher, you're good. If not, or if you get an error, install Node.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Homebrew installation option]\n\nThe easiest way on Mac is using Homebrew (home-brew). If you don't have Homebrew, install it first by going to brew.sh (brew dot S-H) and running the command they show.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Node install via Homebrew]\n\nOnce Homebrew is ready, type: brew install node\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nThat'll get you the latest Node version.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: npm install command for Mac]\n\nNow install Claude Code. Type: npm install dash g at anthropic slash claude-code\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Possible permission error]\n\nIf you get a permission error, you might need to prefix with sudo. Type: sudo npm install dash g at anthropic slash claude-code\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nEnter your Mac password when prompted. This gives npm temporary administrator privileges to install globally.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Authentication]\n\nOnce installed, authenticate by typing: claude\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Browser authentication flow]\n\nYour default browser opens to Anthropic's authentication page. Sign in with your Anthropic account and authorize the connection.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Verification]\n\nBack in Terminal, verify it works: claude \"Hello, are you working?\"\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nIf Claude responds, you're done. Mac users, skip to the end.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n---\n\n## LINUX INSTALLATION\n\n[SCREEN: Linux penguin logo]\n\nLinux users, you're probably comfortable in the terminal already, so this will be quick.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Terminal prompt]\n\nOpen your terminal. Verify Node.js is installed: node dash dash version\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Installing Node on Linux]\n\nIf you need Node, use your distribution's package manager. For Ubuntu or Debian (deb-ee-an), you'll want to use NodeSource (node-source) for the latest version. Commands are in your lesson resources.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nFor Fedora (feh-DOR-ah) or Red Hat, use dnf. For Arch, use pacman. Check the resources for your specific distribution.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: npm install command]\n\nOnce Node is ready: npm install dash g at anthropic slash claude-code\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nIf you get permission issues, you can use sudo, or better yet, configure npm to install global packages in your home directory. The safer approach avoids permission issues long-term. Instructions are in the resources.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Authentication]\n\nAuthenticate: claude\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Browser may not open automatically]\n\nDepending on your setup, the browser might not open automatically. If not, copy the URL (U-R-L) from the terminal output and paste it into your browser.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Login and authorize]\n\nLog in to Anthropic, authorize the connection, and you're done.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Verification]\n\nVerify: claude \"Hello, are you working?\"\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n---\n\n## API KEY SETUP (ALTERNATIVE METHOD)\n\n[SCREEN: API Key option callout]\n\nQuick aside: there's an alternative authentication method using an API key directly. Some advanced users prefer this.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Anthropic Console API Keys section]\n\nGo to console.anthropic.com (console dot anthropic dot com). Navigate to API Keys. Click \"Create Key.\"\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Key creation]\n\nName it something descriptive like \"Claude Code Local.\" Copy the key immediately. You won't be able to see it again.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Environment variable setup]\n\nSet it as an environment variable. On Mac or Linux: export ANTHROPIC underscore API underscore KEY equals your-key-here\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nAdd that line to your shell configuration file, dot bashrc (dot bash-R-C) or dot zshrc (dot Z-S-H-R-C), to make it permanent.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Windows environment variable]\n\nOn Windows with WSL, same process in your Ubuntu terminal.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nThis method is useful if you're using Claude Code in CI/CD (C-I-C-D) pipelines or automated scripts where browser login isn't practical.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n---\n\n## TROUBLESHOOTING COMMON ISSUES\n\n[SCREEN: Troubleshooting header]\n\nLet's cover common issues people run into.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Issue 1 - npm not found]\n\nIssue one: \"npm not found.\" This means Node.js isn't installed or isn't in your PATH (path). Reinstall Node and make sure to restart your terminal after installation.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Issue 2 - Permission denied]\n\nIssue two: \"Permission denied\" on global install. Either use sudo, which works but isn't ideal, or configure npm to use a different directory for global packages. Search for \"npm global without sudo\" for guides.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Issue 3 - Browser doesn't open]\n\nIssue three: Browser doesn't open during authentication. Copy the URL (U-R-L) manually from the terminal. It'll be printed in the output.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Issue 4 - Authentication fails]\n\nIssue four: Authentication fails. Check that you're logged into the correct Anthropic account. Check that your account has API access enabled. Free credits should be available for new accounts.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Issue 5 - WSL specific issues]\n\nIssue five, Windows-specific: WSL won't install. Make sure virtualization is enabled in your BIOS (BY-ose). This is a hardware setting that some computers have disabled by default. Search for your computer model plus \"enable virtualization\" for instructions.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Community support callout]\n\nIf you hit something not covered here, post in the community forum with your operating system, the exact error message, and what you've tried. We'll help you through it.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n---\n\n## CLOSING\n\n[SCREEN: All platforms checkmark graphic]\n\nWhether you're on Windows, Mac, or Linux, you should now have Claude Code installed and authenticated.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Quick verification command]\n\nRun that quick test one more time: claude \"Tell me a short joke.\"\n\n[PAUSE]\n\nIf Claude responds with something at least mildly amusing, you're ready for the next lesson.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Next lesson preview]\n\nComing up: Your First Claude Code Session. We'll explore the interface, learn the essential commands, and start having productive conversations with your new AI development partner.\n\n[PAUSE]\n\n[SCREEN: Fade to \"Next: Your First Claude Code Session\" with Support Forge branding]\n\n---\n\n**END OF SCRIPT 2.1**\n\n*Approximate word count: 1,750 words*\n*Estimated runtime: 14:30-15:30*\n",
